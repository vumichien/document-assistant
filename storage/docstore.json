But, beyond the media  hype, there is \na real revolution happening. To understand the potential, just consider \nthe recent advances in domains like  Computer Vision  or Natural Lan-\nguage Processing  and their applications . \nThe abili ty of a computer to \u2018see\u2019 is an astonishing achievement. AI -\npowered systems can \u2018understand\u2019 the context of an image or a video at \nan impressive level of detail. They can identify a growing  set of entities \n\u2014 such as persons, named individuals, cars, buildi ngs, and eventually any \nobject  \u2014 with increasing levels of accuracy. For example, given an image \nor video, algorithms can estimate properties such as the number of per-\nsons in the picture, their gender, age, their emotional state , or even the \noccasion  and the dynamics . Computer Vision is making huge steps, with \nmassive applications in autonomous cars, navigation, robotics, medical \ndiagnosis, and more.  \nA chat with one of the popular digital assistants  like Alexa or Siri  is \nsufficient to demonst rate the advances of Natural Language Processing \ntechnologies. Digital assistants are becom ing more intelligent, contex-\ntual, and proactive \u2013 they continuously learn by leveraging every single \ninteraction with the user. At some point soon, digital assistant s will be-\ncome autonomous by seamlessly leveraging deep knowledge about the \nuser, signals from the user\u2019s environment, and global trends and dynam-\nics. Your digital assistant will respond naturally, in a conversational \nmode , and possibly with a style, attitu de, and humor that match es your \npersonality and your current mood.  \nAI is changing our socioeconomic system and redefines the way we \nwork, live, collaborate, decide, and act as  individuals , businesses,  or so-\ncieties. We have entered a phase of a drastic tran sformation of markets, \nbusinesses, education, government, social welfare systems, companies, \nemployment models, and social structures.

Autonomous trucks, smart containers, driver -less taxis, and \nsmart cities are just some examples of the new era . Consumer habits will \npossibly shift from owning a car to consuming smart car services , on de-\nmand. Entire transportation networks consisting of fleets of autonomous \ncars will be orchestrated by AI algorithms and adapt in real -time to de-\nmand, traffic, and other conditions. This will transform the way people \ncommute along with the way cities operate and grow  \u2013 leading to a more \nefficient, sustainable , and safe transportation system . As another exam-\nple, AI is chan ging how  we build products and services : physical product \nmanufacturing processes already benefit from AI -powered production \nlines, automated quality control systems, and continuous improvement \nprocesses.  \nI believe that u nder certain assumptions, this techn ological revolution \nwill lead to a new era of prosperity, creativeness, and well -being.  While \nthere will be disruption in  employment patterns and a certain level of \ntechnological unemployment, AI will create numerous new roles and spe-\ncializations  \u2014 with a focus on technology and science . In most cases, AI \nwill play a supportive role to humans \u2014 empowering people to perform \nbetter in handling complex and critical situations that require judgment \nand creative thinking. The general adoption of AI will allow people to free \nup time from monotonous , low -value work, and engage with more crea-\ntive and strategic activities . The workforce and the underlying employ-\nment models will move from long -term, full -time commitments , to flexi-\nble, adaptive  model s of services  and value exchange . Moreover, AI will \nempower p eople to discover and learn more. S mart content discovery  \nand collaboration  tools will give everyone access to the world\u2019s digitized \nknowledge , ideas, and talent . The education system will be improved  by \nAI-powered experiences on top of world -scale digitized content and data, \nalong with scientific and general knowledge. For example, intelligent \u2018ed-\nucation agents\u2019 will be able to capture the needs of each  student and \nsynthesize optimal, personalized edu cational programs \u2014 matching stu-\ndent s\u2019 intent, setting the right level and pace, and utilizing optimal syn-\nthesis of content and experiences.  As a result, I do believe that there will \nbe streams of new business opportunities and a strong basis for entre-\npren eurship, creativeness , and innovation.  In the health space, AI will \nbring more accurate medical diagnoses, personalized medicine, and \nshorter drug development cycles that will significantly improve the over-\nall effectiveness, level of service, and general access to health services.  \nBut of course , there are risks and concerns associated with the appli-\ncation  of AI. We need to find ways to ensure that AI is used in the interes t \nof our society  - and this is not only a responsibility of the policy makers.  \nPeople need to achieve a general awareness and sufficient understand-\ning of the technology, its potential, benefits, and associated risks.

It fo-\ncuses, in particular, on getting the machine to solve tasks that are not \neasily completed with a fixed set of instructions. These days this is ac-\ncomplished with Machine Learning (ML) where a  machine is taught to \nsolve more complex problems through what (for the most part) can be \ndescribed as a \u2018trial and error \u2019 process, making mistakes and then cor-\nrecting for those mistakes based on feedback until it gets things right.  \nFor a formal definition  of the scientific discipline of AI  (as for my def-\ninition for a 5 -year -old), AI can be applied to any case where complex \ntasks can be completed by some artificially created system (machine). \nAgain, in modern times, this has predominantly focused on the area of \nMachine Learning. Most prominently, Deep Learning (DL), a subdiscipline \nof ML where artificial Neural Networks contai ning many layers of artifi-\ncial \u2018neurons \u2019 are trained to complete these tasks , has become central to \nthe large advances we have made over the past decade. Neural network \napplications have dramatically advanced our ability to solve complex \ntasks involving computer vision, understanding and working with lan-\nguage, representing and organizing complex data structures, commerce, \nrecommendations,  and much more.  \nMike Tamir, PhD  is a data science lead er, specializing in deep learning, NLP , and dis-\ntributed scalable machine learning.

If we want to draw some parallel s with similar de-\nvelopments in the 20th  century, we can say that AI is as transformative \nas the discoveries of nuclear power, vaccine, or the internet!  \nAI is supposed to be a human \nbeing\u2019s \u2018intelligent companion.\u2019  \n- Dr. Tirthajyoti Sarkar  \nHowever, the idea of AI is not a 21st -century one. Highl y intelligent \nand visionary men and women have been thinking about it since at least \nthe 1950s. The core idea started at the same time computers were first \nbeing developed to aid human beings with  routine tasks like business \ncalculations or spreadsheet preparation. AI pioneers (such as Alan Tu-\nring and John McCarthy) started envisioning a computer system (combi-\nnation of hardware and software) that do es not just carry out repetitive \ninstruction but c an develop a capability of thinking for itself. They \nthought, that if such a machine can be developed, then it would be a faith-\nful companion to human beings for all kind s of intellectual tasks \u2013 help-\ning us in discovering new scientific facts, designing bet ter products and \nservices, and solving great challenges that the world faces, making eve-\nrybody\u2019s lives a lot better.  In that sense, AI is  supposed to be a human \nbeing\u2019s \u2018intelligent companion \u2019 who may look and feel different (a com-\nputer program or a robot)  but think, converse, and perceive the world just \nlike us and provide us all the help to make it better. There has been a lot \nof research and development in the AI field since those early days. Today, \nthe largest organizations (both private and Governmenta l) around the \nworld are investing huge amount s of money and human resources in this \nfield. Some of the brightest minds in the academia and industry are work-\ning on solving tough problems related to AI.  \nHowever, the current focus is on something called \u2018Nar row AI\u2019 that \ndoes not aim to become the general -purpose intelligent companion of \nhuman being s that we talked about but focuses on solving a narrow, spe-\ncific task at hand. This \u2018Narrow AI \u2019 is a specialized tool, and there will be \nmany such AI tools for all kinds of tasks , such as  making a movie recom-\nmendation, playing video games, helping with automatic driving, helping \nindustrial operations in factories, assisting doctors with  healthcare deliv-\nery, even discovering new medicines and vaccines.  \nIn contrast, Ar tificial General Intelligence (AGI) is supposed to have \nthe true thinking and analysis faculties of a human mind, sufficient for", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2634, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86172bd7-684d-4854-83de-96663c809838": {"__data__": {"id_": "86172bd7-684d-4854-83de-96663c809838", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88062f0c-b892-4330-815e-73aa7b815eba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "12c9a775e46a9efc7f7f36673643ea7cef513b401c8e5af656c890b4fe447e5b"}}, "hash": "4d495be9b92d980a9920959a49a85ac56973822952f1a55471a419eff8ffdd45", "text": "How would you explain A I to a 5 -year -old? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 12 - \n handling all general -purpose everyday tasks. Such an AGI system may \nnot be the master of a single task but can handle any task at least at the \nlevel that a human can do. Naturally, we also expect an AGI system to \nunderstand the world around us - through vision, audio, and language \ncommunication - as well as a human being is expected to. Unfortunately, \nthere is no such AGI system i n sight today. Understanding visual clues \nand natural languages (e.g., English, not some computer programming \nlanguage like Python) has turned out to be the toughest task for AI tools \nto handle. A lot of progress is being made and researchers are hoping to  \nget to some level of AGI within this century.  \nModern AI systems mostly work by learning from examples. Careful \nprogramming allows humans to feed a huge amount of data into these \nsystems autonomously. Generally, this data is in the form of scenarios \nand th eir responses. AI programs analyze that data, find the hidden pat-\nterns, and construct a mathematical model of how that data could have \nbeen generated and also what response goes with what scenario. Next \ntime, a new data point or scenario is presented to th e AI, the model  can \npredict the correct response without explicit programming or instruction. \nIn that sense, it becomes a prediction machine and helps humans solve \nmany challenging problems.  \nFor example, given medical test results, an AI system  can predic t \nwhat probable ailments a patient may have, thereby aiding a doctor. Or, \nit can predict what movie you may like given the preference data about \nyour friends and what movies they have liked in the past. Please note, \nhowever, that the AI tool that makes the  movie recommendation is com-\npletely different (in inner workings and programming) than the one that \nhelps a doctor assess medical ailments. That\u2019s why they all are individ-\nual, Narrow -AI systems.  \nDr. Tirthajyoti Sarkar  is a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence leader.

For \nexample,  in the future, AI will enabl e a computer to demonstrate  empathy , \nand act in such ways that make it difficult to tell whether you are talking \nto a human being or an  AI \u2013 thus passing the famous Turing test chal-\nlenge.  \nAny device that includes a modern computer inside, can perform sim-\nple task s that require a type of intelligence. Imagine that you want to type \nin the word \u2018Robot \u2019; while you are trying to type it, the AI  can help you \nautocomplete the word and even autocorrect it in case you have mis-\nspelled it. Like humans, AI is capable of learning . Using Machine Learn-\ning, if you feed a computer with data , after a while it will be able to distin-\nguish a chair from a table or a bird from a tree. It would be also able to \ngroup different objects or predict whether it is going to rain tomorrow or \neven if  you are happy or sad  while you are talking to the AI . Sometimes  \nthis AI can even learn on its own and perform tasks or even self-correct  \nits own program.  \nSounds strange? I would rather say it is complex rather than strange. \nLet me give you some more familiar examples. You may have used Net-\nflix to watch your favourite tv series or film . Have you ever wondered how  \nNetflix displays first your preferences and how it recommends you watch  \nsimilar tv shows? Well,  that is possible based on the technology  behind \nNetflix that knows what you like because you have been  feeding it  with \ndata  \u2013 e.g. how long you watched a film , what was the theme, or the \ngenre.  And with that data , the AI finds and promotes the most suitable \ncontent for you. In other words,  you teach the AI system what you like and \nit responds back  with recommendations .  \nThere are many  definitions of AI, but for now , you can think of it as \u2018a \nnear -to-human -like intelligence that ha s cognitive functions like humans \ndo, and reacts intelligently to external stimuli.  There are also many types \nof A Is; some  perform simple tasks while  other s perform more complex  \nones .  \nThe term \u2018Narrow AI \u2019 describe s algorithms that focus on  performing \na simple task , like playing a game of Connect 4, a game of tic -tac-toe, or \neven predict ing the weather based on specific data.  Narrow AI does not \ninteract outside its predefined limits. Even though we might like a  futur-\nistic world like in the film \u2018Minority Report \u2019 or the film \u2018I Robot \u2019, the truth is \nthat we are mostly surrounded by Narrow AI that perform s simplistic \ntasks withou t having human -like cognitive  abilities . You shouldn\u2019t under-\nestimate Narrow AI though , since it makes our lives so much more effort-\nless, like performing repetitive tasks faster  and more accurate ly than hu-\nmans - and, most importa ntly, tirelessly.  \nOn the other hand , when  an AI system has reached a high  level of \ncognitive abilities  that imitate human thinking , we will have reached the", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3145, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56c4f7b7-63f4-40d1-aa60-bdaa368b7dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "56c4f7b7-63f4-40d1-aa60-bdaa368b7dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "73469e04-d3f4-4c37-a22d-2a62cdd753ee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "7a9c81fe5b5ed0bae19dd48a058f9f3292ea895eb25aece74366afb974fb121f"}}, "hash": "fe3cf8b75cb1323f44caff938bc4697ae525036d1ceb82ac46e055a62765b930", "text": "How would you explain A I to a 5 -year -old? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 14 - \n \u2018General \u2019 or \u2018Super AI \u2019.

This \ntrend is further accelerated by the pandemic, driving the rapid adoption \nof contactless digital technologies, many of which require AI to provide \na good user experience. So how can you  get involved and be successful \nin this exciting field?  \nClearly, a solid foundation in STEM1 education is crucial. AI is essen-\ntially applied Machine Learning to automate everyday human decisions \nand actions , with the ability to learn and improve through feedback. And \nmachine learning (ML) is nothing more than applied Statistics to large -\nscale problems with high dimensionality. So you are going to need the \nMath (mainly linear algebra and numerical optimization ) and Statistics \nbackground to think and talk like an AI professional. And you are going \nto need the coding and Computer Science (CS) skills to turn your brilliant \nideas into efficient and scalable algorithms.  \nAI is inherently an interdiscipli-\nnary subject . \n- Dr. Michael Wu  \nThis foundation is a stepping stone to a successful career in AI, but \nit\u2019s insufficient because AI is evolving so rapidly. Although many univer-\nsities are offering programs in Data Science, they can\u2019t keep pace with \nthe latest technologies in the industry. This is where boot camps and \nconference workshops come in handy, but you do need the Math, Stats, \nand CS background to get the most out of these extracurricular training.  \nFinally, to be successful in AI, you will need to enrich the fundamen-\ntals you learned from school (which tends to be very generic) with do-\nmain -specific knowledge (which is rarely taught in school) through intern-\nships. This will also provide you with hands -on experi ence with large -\nscale cloud -based storage and computing technologies that are crucial \nfor developing, deploying, and maintaining real-world, AI-based solutions.  \n \n1 Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics - Wikiwand", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2133, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d255a4b-25f1-4411-af06-9ea0500dddec": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d255a4b-25f1-4411-af06-9ea0500dddec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "727ec817-5735-4fc0-ba67-d4b26b81accf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "9c0f87c989058df3ddfe93bbe20ce693cdcbaf14b3fd4c02be2968fa6fe88555"}}, "hash": "e4be1d89f9ca652168a418c50d1f71b09946b9876a548f64a4c14c96fb42b0e5", "text": "What is the academic curriculum for a successful \ncareer in AI? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE  - 19 - \n Because the field of AI is growing so fast, it\u2019s already impossible for \nany one person to keep up-to-date with all the latest technologies and \ninnovations. AI professionals have no choice but to specialize. In indus-\ntries, there are already specializations based on different stages of the \ndata lifecycle. There are Data Engineers responsible for captu ring and \nstoring the data necessary to train the ML. Data Scientists are generally \nfocused on using these data to train ML models to address business \nproblems. Then there are engineers working in ML Ops2, and they are re-\nsponsible for deploying the trained  ML model to the cloud, so they can \nbe used anywhere the cloud is accessible via the internet. Moreover, \nthere are technical specializations in AI that depend on the domains (e.g. \nautonomous vehicles, natural language processing, etc.), data types (e.g. \nimage, video, text, etc.), coding language (e.g. Python, Java, R, etc.), and \neven the growing number of tools and packages (e.g. Tensor Flow, \nPyTorch, SciKit -Learn, etc.).  \nThere are even specializations based on the development lifecycle of \nthe AI solution.  AI researchers tend to focus on the development of new \nML algorithms, which leverage new data sources or use different ML par-\nadigms. Although many industrial applications of ML use the Supervised \nLearning paradigm (which includes deep learning), there are  more and \nmore applications that leverage Ensemble Learning, Reinforcement \nLearning, Adversarial Learning, One-shot Learning, and many others (e.g. \nSemi-supervised, Unsupervised, Active, Online, Transfer  or Transductive \nlearning, etc.). AI researchers may sometimes need to develop new learn-\ning paradigms to optimize the utilization of the available training data.  \nOnce a new ML algorithm is developed and tested, they are ready for \nuse in AI applications. This is where AI Solution Architects and AI Appli-\ncation  Engineers come in. Due to the rapidly evolving field around AI, \nthese titles will likely change over time. Because they aim to build AI so-\nlutions to address business problems, they are sometimes referred to as \nAI Data Scientists or AI Scientists in genera l. These AI Scientists will de-\nsign and build AI applications using the new ML algorithm as a mecha-\nnism to learn through feedback data. This will enable the AI applications \nto improve upon the decision it automates , with usage. Although the spe-\ncializations in AI arose out of practicality, it\u2019s perfectly fine to be a jack of \nall trades in AI, but you do need to have expertise in at least one area to \nbe successful.  \nAs you can see, it\u2019s not easy to be at the center of the AI revolution. If \nyou can check all the  boxes mentioned above, you are likely a very good \nAI scientist already. However, AI is a very versatile tool, and it can be ap-\nplied to such a wide range of problems that it\u2019s been said that AI will cat-\nalyze the Fourth Industrial Revolution3.

AI requires varied skills and dif-\nferent roles throughout the data science life cycle. There are many spe-\ncialised roles in AI, the most characteristic ones being:  \n- AI Architect s determine what business problems to solve .

A data engineer is a comprehensive data specialist who prepares \ndata and makes it available within your organization. By extracting \ninformation from different systems, transforming, cleaning data, and \ncombining different sources into a working database, da ta engineers \nbecome an important piece of the puzzle in the AI process. They an-\nalyze and cleanse the collected data from the various systems and \ntools, used in an ecosystem. To uncover the hidden treasures in a \ncompany's data, these individuals need to deeply understand busi-\nness processes.  \n- Data scientists  train the models using the prepared data . They u se \nmachine learning and predictive analytics to collect, analyze, and in-\nterpret large amounts of data to gain insights that go beyond statisti-\ncal analysis. A  data scientist builds machine learning or deep learning \nmodels to help organisations improve efficiencies.  \n- AI or Machine Learning Engineers  deploy the models . Once the mod-\nels are built, the process is very similar to the software development \nlifecycle. The role of an AI/ML engineer is to develop deployable mod-\nels from models developed by data scientists and integrate the mod-\nels into the final product. AI enginee rs also develop secure APIs for \ndelivering models on demand.  \n- AI Strategist s work in research or real -world solutions . They should \nhave hybrid skills in both technology and business. A good AI strate-\ngist understands the power of both technology and business ; they \nmust be  able to explore the art of the possible as the means of trans-\nform ing the business. They also identify the important AI projects for \nthe organisation and strategize the AI journey for the organization.

This includes:  \n- Data Engineering . An AI/data team will need d ata, of course, and pro-\nfessionals focused on managing large volumes of data for pro-\ncessing and preparation . These professionals, often called Data En-\ngineers , need a moderate (though not extensive) background as soft-\nware developers and must have a strong ba ckground in the principles \nof parallel processing with map -reduce concepts and the latest tech-\nnologies for implementing them. Data Engineers will also have a \nstrong background in mathematical literacy and must be fluent in the \nkinds of mathematical transfo rmations applied to their data.   \n- Data/ML Science . Scientists/applied researchers work with the data \nto draw conclusions (especially predictions). The highest functioning \nscientists in this role will use the best tools at our disposal and so \noften (but not essentially) use ML. Ideally , an ML scientist will focus \nmost of their time hypothesizing what kind of techniques (ML mod-\nels) will detect desired patterns or generate successful predictive re-\nsults, run experiments to test these hypotheses, and then conduct  ex-\ntensive analys is to understand if their hypotheses were validated \n(and in what ways). The best Data/ML scientists will have extensive \n(graduate level) ML training in addition to mathematical literacy, es-\npecially in the area of linear algebra, and ideall y functional analysis. \nThey will need decent coding ability but need not be software engi-\nneers. They will also require a background in statistical modeling , at \nminimum having a strong background in probability theory and hy-\npothesis testing.   \n- ML Engineering . To make the team most efficient, I often like to have \na dedicated group of ML engineers. An ML engineer\u2019s job is to de-\nvelop centralized code for the scientists to use to eliminate practical \nsoftware challenges reproducing boilerplate code so that they ca n fo-\ncus on understanding their experiments rather than implementing, \ndebugging , and ensuring that their results have parity with prior work. \nML engineers will fundamentally be software engineers but will have \na working understanding of (though perhaps not graduate -level train-\ning in) the machine learning and mathematical literacy expected of \nscientists.  \nMike Tamir, PhD  is a data science leader, specializing in deep learning, NLP, and dis-\ntributed scalable machine learning.

Many pro-\nfessors post their course notes and lecture videos o nline (as I do), so I \nwould recommend trying to watch those to gain more knowledge.  \nThe best way (in my view) to learn Machine Learning after taking a \ncourse is to work on a real problem. There is a lot to learn because real \ndata science is messy: it takes effort to specify the goals correctly (based \non what the domain experts say) and to collect and clean the data. It is \ncommon to  find that the problem has been formulated in a problematic \nway and needs to be fixed. Important pieces of advice are:  \n1. Keep in mind that Neural Networks are excellent for computer vision, \nbut they don't tend to give an advantage on many other kinds of dat a. \nThus, it is worthwhile to learn other techniques besides Neural Net-\nworks, as they can be difficult to train, and are often black boxes.  \n2. Interpretable Machine Learning is critical for fairness and trust, but it \nis a topic that is rarely taught in course s.  \n3. Ethics are important. Data scientists should evaluate the ethics of the \nproject themselves, not just do what their manager tells them!

These folks are also called \u2018Data plumbers \u2019 as they \nliterally build the essential plumbing infrastructure through which da-\ntasets flow. If you can imagine the AI system as a pipeline (raw data \nas input and intelligent insights as output), then data engineers build, \nmaintain, and improve these pipes.  They are mostly concerned about \nhow the raw data will come in from all kinds of sources \u2013 standalone \ndatabase s, web API s, gRPC calls, industrial protocol services, sensor \nnetworks, etc. They also ensure the smooth flow of that data (through \nall the transf ormations) to various part s of the AI/ML system and sub -\ncomponents as data scientists and ML engineers need it.  \n- Machine Learning engineers .

However, \nwith the adv ent and rapid rise of MLOps (think of it as a fusion be-\ntween Machine Learning and Software Engineering DevOps), the role \nof ML engineers is becoming more specialized.

Statistically speaking, most profes-\nsionals come from some sort of STEM background with Computer Sci-\nence, Electrical/ Electronic Engineering, and Physics background s being \nthe majority. A lot of Data Scientists come from Applied Mathematics \nand Statistics background s. \nProgramming skills are highly desired and useful for any AI role but \nnot everybody comes with  years of experience with coding and software \ndevelopment. It is nothing to be worried about and can be picked up with \ndiligent practice and self -learning (even on -the-job training).  \nA general inclination towards mathematical thinking and an analyti-\ncal mindset is almost a necessary prerequisite. Experimental mentality \nand curiosity to solve problems using logical thinking and data -driven \nmethodologies are what matte r most.  \nSome roles are greatly benefited from specialized experience. For ex-\nample, Data Engineers will benefit from previous database management \nexperience, Data Scientists from Statistical model building experience, \nand ML engineers from Software deployme nt experience.  \nThese days, new, exciting roles are getting created at all levels of or-\nganizations for making AI a truly transformative force. For example, AI \napplication scientist or AI product manager will be in charge of pitching \nthe great features of an  AI-enabled product or platform in front of poten-\ntial customers. A background in marketing, product engineering , or sales \ncan help them. AI Ethics is a new and expanding field that looks at the \nethical and moral implication s and boundaries of AI applicatio ns and \nhow complex dilemmas can be solved. People with social science back-\nground s (e.g., philosophy) are filling many such roles in top organiza-\ntions.  \nOverall, AI is a vast and complex field with a place for professionals \nwith all sorts of background s.

AI can be broad ly broken into logical (or \nsymbolic) AI and Statistical (or subsymbolic AI). Symbolic AI includes \ntopics like Knowledge Representation, Logical Reasoning , and Plan-\nning. The key idea is that knowledge is represented and reasoned \nupon explicitly. This branch of AI was popular till the 90s with the rise \nof expert systems, rule formalisms , and logical programming lan-\nguages like Prolog. Sub -symbolic AI includes topics like Machine \nLearning, including Deep Learning. The key idea is that knowledge \ncan be learned wi th sufficient data. This branch of AI dramatically in-\ncreased in popularity since the 2000s, and today is probably the dom-\ninant branch. Most AI and Data Science courses focus on subsym-\nbolic AI, but I feel that a true AI system will need a combination of \nSymbolic and Sub-symbolic techniques. Hence, I believe that AI re-\nsearchers must focus on Symbolic AI and its co -existence with Sub-\nsymbolic AI.  \n- Algorithms & Ops . A lot of emphasis today is placed on different al-\ngorithms and techniques for processing data, bu ilding models and \nevaluating or tuning them , but not  on the operationalization of these \nalgorithms for production settings. I believe that an AI curriculum \nmust cover different aspects of AI  or ML  Ops like robustness, scala-\nbility , and monitoring.

This is espe cially important for AI \napplication architects.  \n- Theory & Applications . I believe the AI curriculum must h ave a good \nmixture of theory and applications. For example, for various Machine \nLearning models, AI professionals must understand both the inter-\nnals of the training and scoring algorithms, as well as various appli-\ncations of the model (for solving different  problems in different in-\ndustries). A good understanding of the theory of the algorithms is es-\nsential to understand its behavior and pros and cons. And the use -\ncases are important so that a Data Scientis t or a Researcher quickly \nknows what algorithms to apply for different kinds of problems they \nmight encounter.  \n- Formal Rigor & Story -telling . Todays\u2019  AI curricul um focuses on for-\nmal rigor \u2013 i.e. making sure that the algorithms and techniques per-\nform well in a form al sense (e.g., they have high accuracy, precision, \nrecall , or other metrics ). Not as much emphasis is put on story -telling, \ni.e. creating a story about the data. The story about the data is critical \nto convey the results to business or other stakeholders in an easy -to-\nunderstand manner. The story might include different elements like \nan overview of the key takeaways, a description of the source and \nproperties of the data, a diagnosis of key findings, predictions of what \nmight happen next, and prescriptions  of what actions might be taken \nto optimize some outcomes. The stories help weave different ele-\nments of the data and the models to communicate insights effec-\ntively to the listener. This is especially important for Data Scientists.  \nFor a high -school studen t considering a career in the AI space, I \nwould recommend looking for courses that cover a gamut of the topics I \nmentioned above. This will help them acquire skills that are immediately \nuseful in the marketplace, as well as skills that will be useful even in the \nfuture as the state of AI evolves. Furthermore, I\u2019d recommend them to \ntake inter -disciplinary courses to get more ideas of interesting ways of \napplying AI in different disciplines.  \nAnand  Ranganathan  is a co -founder and the Chief AI Officer at Unscrambl.

Since AI encompasses a broad set of \ntools and methods which are applied to almost every area of our lives \none can approach the field from multiple different angles. In my job , I lead \nan interdisciplinary team to d evelop Artificial Neural Networks and other \nAI tools to be used in clinical practice. In our world, developing and train-\ning the models encompasses only a very small part of the whole devel-\nopment and release journey of AI products. To be successful, we need  to \nunderstand how the AI products are used and by whom; we must under-\nstand how the data we use is generated, this includes understanding \nphysiology, sensors, and instrumentation; we must understand how the \nusers and patients interact with our AI products and are impacted by our \noutputs; and we have to do all of this within the relevant ethical, regula-\ntory, and legal boundaries.  \nIn our world , there is no one way of having a successful career in AI, \nbut overall my impression is that the people who outshine o thers are \nthose who have a strong foundation in a specific field to build on and \nhave an affinity for learning and collaborating with people with very dif-\nferent backgrounds. In our case , we may have engineers having very \ndeep dialogs with medical doctors w here they need to build a mutual un-\nderstanding of how a disease is diagnosed, what are the edge cases, how \nAI is best developed for each use case, and how a wrong diagnosis can \nbe mitigated. It takes strong communication skills to explain and learn \nfrom pe ople who approach the same challenges from very different di-\nrections.  \nFor young people who are interested in pursuing a career in AI , my \nadvice would be to specialize in a field that highly interests you. If you are \ninclined to specialize in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Physics, \nor another technical domain you would learn Programming, Statistics, \nand other relevant hard skills. When you have established your hard skills, \nit becomes increasingly important to understand the ecosystem your AI \nproducts will be used in and to learn to communicate with key stakehold-\ners in that ecosystem.

But to build them, a com-\npany scraped  all our personal photos from the internet! Of course, we did \nnot intend our biometric information to be used for this purpose. Unfor-\ntunately, there are almost no regulations on the collection of such data \nand the use of AI on it, so these problems will co ntinue to occur.  \nIn terms of the characteristic examples of AI, I think the most basic \none is automated handwriting recognition.

In the future (not quite yet) we \nwill hopefully have reliable vision systems for self -driving cars, which \ncould be another characteristic example of AI - after we get it to work! \nBut we should be careful not to launch AI systems too early, in cases \nwhen it is dangerous to do so. Another characteristic example of AI is the \nalgorithms that are used for playing games, such as freestyle chess and \nJeopardy.  \nIn the future, I hope that A I will help humans with creative tasks too. \nMy lab is working on automatically generated poetry and music.

Additionally , any intervention, \nsuch as any initiated treatment, severely biases patients\u2019 health data. \nHence, a predictive model aiming at diagnosing, for instance, the risk of \nmetastases in breast cancer patients, is subject to an excessive numb er \nof factors (variables aka features ) that dramatically reduces any subset \nof available patients to an insufficient number of samples that could be \ndecently used for model training.  \nAnd here the word \u2018decently \u2019 has all connotations: legal, medical, so-\ncial, cultural, ethical, and economical.

It is abundantly clear that AI \nis omnipresent, driving innovation and influencing how businesses run \nand compete. AI has been known for nearly six decades. However , AI was \nthrust to the forefront of the new industrial revolution only recently. AI is \nthe dominant driving force for modernizing a seemingly never -ending list \nof industries and functions such as communications, healthcare, media, \neducation, audit, taxatio n, and operations. In short, the current and future \nuse of AI in innovation can change how people live, work, play, and even \nthink. Below are a few examples of what AI can accomplish today . \nNatural Language Understanding and Generation . AI can process \nnatu ral language, and it can read and comprehend what the intent is in \ndocuments, news articles, blogs, books, and emails . Further more , it can \ngenerate summary information from processing the text and label the \ntext with topics. The technology can detect a question in text and group \nsimilar questions together. Note that humans have a lot of variation in \nspeech, as someone can ask the sam e question differently. Similarly, AI \ncan use existing unstructured data to find answers to these questions. \nThe ability to process unstructured text and respond to the text has fur-\nther been helped by the technology to hear using state -of-the-art pattern \nrecognition speech -to-text (STT) techniques. STT application program-\nming interfaces can convert spoken words by humans into text in real -\ntime. Generating human -like speech is an excellent accomplishment of \nspeech synthesis techniques. Speech synthesis is th e artificial creation \nof human speech where a text to speech (TTS) system converts natural \nlanguage text into speech. This synthesized speech can be created by \nconcatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database, \nand the quality of these speech synthesizers has been becoming more \nand more similar to the human voice every year. Text to speech technol-\nogies leverage Neural Network models  to deliver a human -like, engaging, \nand personalized user experience.

Self-driving cars capture data from their environment and feed it  \nback  to the AI - a loop called the percept ion action cycle . Then, AI makes \ndecisions that enable self -driving cars to perform specific actions in the \nsame environment. This is an iterative process and the more cycles the \nmore accura te the AI model. Moreover,  accumulated data from such cy-\ncles from multiple vehicles help produce intelligence that finally empow-\ners every single vehicle.  \nEvery industry has numerous use cases where AI can be applied.  In \nthe R etailer  industry, companies  are using Computer Vision for checkout , \nseamless transactions , and theft detection. Cities are using Computer \nVision for surveillance to keep the population  safe. In agriculture, Com-\nputer Vision is used to detect weeds and monitor the crop \u2019s health and \ngrowth. Construction and manufacturing industries use AI to run opera-\ntions more safely and efficiently , for instance, they  apply computer vision \nfor defect detection and preventive maintenance.

Technologies  like Artificial Neural Networks \n(ANNs) have contributed significantly to the advancement of AI and its \nmajor adoption by industries worldwide. However,  Neural Networks are \nnot new; they were first introduced back in 1944 by Warren McCullough \nand Walter Pitts, two University of Chicago researchers . The technology  \ntook off only around 2012 with the creation of \u2018AlexNet \u2019 developed by \nAlex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ilya Sutskever which  won the \nImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge . Actually,  before \nthat, the scientific community was ostentatiously ignoring ANNs  and the \nwhole concept.  \nBut what led to the wide adoption and exponential development of \nANNs and why it is so important to the domain of AI? That is mainly be-\ncause of the exponential growth of computational power with GPUs, \nfaster computer networks , and m ore efficient and reusable code librar-\nies. Another reason for the  growth of  ANNs adoption is the huge amount \nof data generated by users and electronic devices (I oT, smartphones) \ngiving the possibility to train ANNs to perform various tasks . Cisco re-\nported that in 2021 there are 27.1 Billion devices 3.5 per capita creating \n33 Zettabytes, predicted to reach a mind -boggling 175ZB by 2025.  \nThe fully autonomous car is a \nclassic example of advanced AI.  \n- George Panou  \nANNs have helped in many different industr ies. In healthcare , for ex-\nample , ANNs are used to predict Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease by \npredicting the disorders with accurate diagnosis at early stages. IBM has \nused its AI Watson to detect cancer from MRIs and correlate clinical trials \nand medicine s specific for the type of cancer through a huge dataset \nhelping sav e the lives of patients. Actually,  by digitizing the neurons of \nthe brain  and then train ing the ANNs properly with the right data you may \nend up finding correlations between dependent and independent varia-\nbles that humans may fail to correlate.

Even the \nmaintenance of the robots uses predictive algorithms to determine when \nmachinery needs to be taken out of the production line to be serviced. \nThe servicing would be done by other robots too.  \nOnce  the products roll off the production line, they enter a fully auto-\nmated supply chain that has taken the order from the customer. It will \nthen not only deliver the product to the front door of that customer, but \nalso interface with a home help robot to rec eive the parcel, unpack it , and \nput it in the correct location in the home. All these are done with zero \ninteraction with a human. Moreover, the customer 's need for the product \ncould be predicted by AI so the order is placed automatically to ensure  \nthat th e product is available when the customer wants it.  \nWhile all of this sounds like a perfect utopian world, it has some sig-\nnificant implications.

Apple iPhones use facial recognition to identify users and provide \nsecure access to banking apps. The e xamples from everyday life are too \nnumerous to list.  \nAI is not just for Big Tech. The key challenge for organizations not \n\u201cdoing AI\u201d is to put in place the foundations necessary for AI innovation \nand implementation.

The industry is also col-\nlecting more and more data from various sour ces (think smartwatches \nor remote patient monitoring devices) that, if leveraged  effectively , can \ndisrupt the industry and create huge opportunit ies to improve patient out-\ncomes.  \nAI can help identify  potential \ndrug targets with a high likeli-\nhood of providing positive pa-\ntient outcomes . \n- Raj Madan  \nSo how can AI bring value to the healthcare industry? While the appli-\ncation of AI in Healthcare continues to grow, here are the top use cases:  \n- Diagnostics . AI-based image recognition  and matching technology \nhas evolved rapidly over the last few years and has created opportu-\nnities  for specialists (think radiologists) to validate their findings . In \nparallel, this technology is already starting to put diagnostics in the \nhands of patients , for instance,  to empowe r them to initially diagnose \nskin and eye conditions. As an example of where this is being used, \nas per Google4, \u201c2 billion people around the world have skin, hair, and \nnail conditions\u201d  and in response to this need, they recently launched \nthe DermAssist t ool which allows you to \u201cfind personalized infor-\nmation about your skin concerns after a few questions and three quick \nphotos\u201d  and can \u201cidentify 288 skin, nail and hair conditions\u201d .  \n- Drug Discovery and Development . Historically, less than 10% of drug \ncandid ates commercialize . The entire process can take about 10 -15 \nyears  and the costs are normally in the millions (if not billions) of dol-\nlars. This is where AI can help reduce lead times and costs by ( a) \nidentifying potential drug targets (a molecule in the bo dy, usually a \nprotein, that is intrinsically associated with a particular disease pro-\ncess and that could be addressed by a drug to produce a desired ther-\napeutic effect5) that ha ve a high likelihood of providing positive \n \n4 Identify Skin Conditions with DermAssist - Google Health  \n5 Drug Target - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2148, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f3af669-301c-4f95-8365-745b095670f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f3af669-301c-4f95-8365-745b095670f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53b03632-a507-40d4-8fc9-2f0da7dd2ee3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "f9a96bae3a11e962e5fd00d2353e24ecba944a74e6dc865d88f19632275a3a0b"}}, "hash": "261dc879bd8908f7353d3c056987119ca09921d03adde3db7073d96d8dd2f55f", "text": "How is AI impacting the way  businesses operate ? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 50 - \n patient outcomes for a specific dis ease or therapeutic area and then \n(b) understanding how patient cohorts will interact and react to that \ndrug target. How do AI models do this? AI models generally parse and \nsearch through a vast amount of scientific data sets, look for \nmatches (often by also considering existing drug targets  in other ther-\napeutic areas) and analyze/predict their safety and efficacy profiles.  \nNow, the use of AI doesn\u2019t come with a lack of challenges and risks \nin the healthcare industry. For starters, the healthcare ecosystem con-\nsists of several players \u2013 think  providers (healthcare systems, doctors, \netc.), payers (insurance companies) , and then pharma and biotech com-\npanies (that often perform drug discovery /development activities and \ncommercialize these products) . This means  that for AI to deliver value \nacross the entire healthcare value chain, frictionless coordination and in-\ntegration is necessary , which has often been difficult to date.  \nAdditionally, the healthcare industry is highly regulated , and the use \nof AI to provide and replace human -based diagnosis , although not impos-\nsible to achieve , will continue to be a steep climb and one that will always \ncontinue to require human intervention in my opinion - until AI models are \n100% error -proof. Lastly, the promise of AI lies in its adoption , and with \nan increased  focus and concern about data privacy and security, organi-\nzations deploying AI ( especially directly to patients) need to ensure that \npatients have complete transparency to how their data is used, stored, \nand controlled.  \nRaj Madan  has over 20 years of digital transformation and innovation experience and \nis currently the CDIO at Arcutis Biotherapeutics.

Although cutting -edge technology and tal-\nent are  needed to drive AI transformation, it is equally if not more im-\nportant for leadership to align the organization\u2019s culture and strategy \nto support AI. Alignment of corporate strategy with AI strategy and \ndefinition of measurable goals and objectives are ne cessary to pre-\nvent disjointed programs  \n- Ethics and Governance . Ethics and governance capabilities are \nneeded to define transparency, explainability, appropriate use of data \nsources, fairness appraisal, and compliance with regulatory and legal \nrequirements.  Technical processes for testing the behavior of algo-\nrithms through a quality assurance process play a critical role here.  \n- Data . Data is the seed across all enterprises that allow for AI to scale, \nand hence, data must be accurate to the extent possible and  unbi-\nased to train systems continuously. The more data available, the \nmore the system\u2019s learning can advance. Although data availability \nand quality may seem like a straightforward concept across organi-\nzations, even organizations within the same industry s till have differ-\nent maturity levels.  \n- AI and Data Science . The maturity of the data drives better outcomes \nfor an enterprise, but it is the methods and the science applied to the \ndata that help draw meaningful insights and make intelligent deci-\nsions. This a ssessment identifies the use of mathematical modeling \ntechniques and the maturity of the methods and models.  \n- Technology Infrastructure . A solid technical foundation is a critical \ncomponent for AI transformation and contributes to developing a \nsupporting ec osystem.  \n \n1 D. Simchi -Levi, J. Gadewadikar, B. McCarthy and L.

The data & AI journey \ntypically consists of different phases inc luding:  \n- Exploration . In this phase , you will explore a few quick & dirty (busi-\nness) opportunities to assess whether you want to embark on the \njourney. This phase usually takes from several months up  to a year \nand requires little investment. Once you are co nvinced that there is \nvalue, you will move to the next phase.  \n- Transformation . In this phase, you start to organize yourself to be-\ncome more data -driven. You will perform an analysis to find the most \ninteresting use cases (applications) to start with, consid ering value  \nas well as feasibility . You need to break silos (technological, depart-\nmental, vendors) and collect data across the enterprise into a coordi-\nnated platform. You will need to hire a CDO and set up a data team, \nclosely collaborating with IT and HR.  You will need to work on a \u2018single \nversion of the truth \u2019 so that the whole enterprise understands data in \nthe same way without ambiguity. This phase will require significant \ninvestment and may take between three and five years. Be prepared \nto have some patience as an organization.  \n- Data -driven . In this phase , you will st art to enjoy the results of your \nendurance in the first years. You will be able to use data in a con-\nsistent way to inform the big decisions you have to make related to \nyour core business.

Having reached this point, the organization already has \na backlog of use cases to be addressed, and this backlog has been pri-\noritized from the top and communicated throughout the entire organiza-\ntion.  Two major initiatives take place during this phase:  (a) Data Stand-\nardization and (b) Organizational Transformation. To deliver on these in-\nitiatives, the following must be there : \n- Data Sourcing Strategy . This strategy is about what data to use, and  \nwhere to find it but it also aims to address organizational difficulties \nwhere certain functions consider data \u201ctheir property\u201d. Thus, t he Data \nSourcing Strategy also includes how data is  to be shared  across the \norganization.  \n- Discrete Budget . In this state, each department needs to explicitly \nstate their data , analytical or BI requirements,  and this is to be ap-\nproved in the annual budgeting  process.  \n- Formation of a \u2018Data Team \u2019. In this stat e, the organization has real-\nized that a special Data Team is required, with a Chief Data Officer \nheading it. The positioning of this function within the organization is \na whole other discussion, but in general , if we look at successful ini-\ntiatives, we will  see that the CDO is usually placed in organizational \nstructures that are horizontal and apply to the entire business, such \nas IT or the Digital Transformation Team or under the COO. In some \ncases, the CDO can also be under the CEO  but again , this is a topic \nfor another discussion. The Data Team  will consist of data engineers  \nand data scientists and will have worked with IT on the technological \nchoices required to set  up the tools to perform the required work.  \nThe next state is \u2018Data democrati zation\u2019.

As a second step, a small team  needs to be hired , with \nthe following skillsets : \n- Senior Analyst (to collect and analyze company use cases and create \ninternal POCs)  \n- Data Engineer (to put all data sources in one place - internal, eg. Point \nof Sale data, competitive data , etc) \n- Data Scientist (to start using exte rnal services like Google Cloud etc. \nand build some models to complete the P OCs) \nDepending on the POC outcomes and the expected ROI, the company \nmay hire more of the above, eg., if more custom models are required, hire \nmore data scientists.  \nHowever , finding the right talent and training them can be expensive, \nlet alone building an internal AI infrastructure from scratch . Hence, if you \nare not a \u2018heavy data -handling company \u2019, using external APIs to achieve \nyour goal s is key.

It is therefore important to \nstrike a balance between partnering with the right A rtificial Intelligence  \nvendors that have a rapid ROI potential and building your own internal \ncapabilities.  \nThe next step is to iden tify which business area or function to target \nfirst. Rather than trying to introduce AI across organizational processes \nin one go, it is much more judicious to analyze the simple challenges first \nand identify the low -hanging fruit s where AI can be easily integrated  and \ncreate significant value .  \nFor example, an AI -driven pricing solution will always start with a sim-\nple regression model tested on a small set of SKUs.

This \nmeans that all employees would need to be  data -literate and under-\nstand how to use data to make better decisions.  \n- Finally, it\u2019s important to remember that a successful AI transfor-\nmation requires a commitment from all levels of the organization. \nEmployees across the hierarchy need to be on board w ith the new \nstrategy and be willing to work together to make it a success.  \nIf a company can successfully make these changes, it will be able to \nharness the power of big data and become a data -driven, AI -powered or-\nganization.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2612, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dd580fa-80c9-419e-b0b3-f1205af86ba6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dd580fa-80c9-419e-b0b3-f1205af86ba6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae850733-24b7-4407-9a99-bbe89209e833", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "66", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "d153a4629f117a080408d08efc2d020d369ea5c13c8ee3b1ce8284b62e48948c"}}, "hash": "1401d880da6aa8d0ee629b9f2573fd56c65af68bc3e14883611c92dfd29ee6bc", "text": "How to t rans form  a company into an AI -Powered \norganization  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 66 - \n But how could a company find the right talent and form a powerful \nData & AI team?  One option is to hire external service providers who have \nthe necessary skills and experience. This can be a cost -effective way to \nget up and running quickly , as many providers offer  a range of services \nthat cover everything from data management to AI development. Another \noption is to develop an in -house team of AI experts. This can be a more \nexpensive option, but it gives businesses more control over the develop-\nment and implementatio n of AI initiatives. A company could also choose \na hybrid approach, which involves hiring external service providers for \nspecific tasks while developing an in -house team for other tasks.  \nNo matter which approaches a company chooses, it\u2019s important to \nmake  sure that the team has the necessary skills and experience to suc-\ncessfully implement AI initiatives. This includes  skills spanning  Data Sci-\nence, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. When forming a team \nit is important to ensure that there is a diversity of backgrounds and skill-\nsets, so that a variety of viewpoints can be considered when making de-\ncisions about AI.  \nThe time needed to set up a Data and AI function var ies depending \non the size and complexity of the company. However, a good rule of \nthumb is that it will take a minimum of 12 months to get a functioning \nteam in place.  This includes hiring  and training  the right people and get-\nting them up to speed on the compa ny\u2019s data infrastructure and AI tech-\nnologies. It\u2019s important to note that a Data and AI function will require \nongoing development and support, so it\u2019s important to set aside ade-\nquate resources for this.   \nAI has the potential to become a source of different iation for modern \nproducts and services. This is because big tech companies are not well -\npositioned to provide custom AI services to businesses  - they are more \nfocused on developing general -purpose AI technologies that can be used \nby a wide range of busine sses.  However, businesses need specialised AI \nservices that are suitable for their specific domain  and this  is where a \ncompany\u2019s in -house team of AI experts can come in handy, as they can \ndevelop custom AI solutions , tailored to the needs of the business.  \nThe benefits of a data -driven, AI -powered organization are clear: in-\ncreased efficiency, better decision making, and a competitive edge in the \nmarketplace. However, making these changes is not easy, and it requires \na commitment from all levels of the organi zation.  A successful AI trans-\nformation is a continuous journey. This means that a company needs to \ninvest in AI and get prepared over the long term, and not just in the early \nstages of the transformation.  \nAruna Pattam  is a Global AI Thought Leader with 22+ years of experience in data ana-\nlytics, AI, and ML.

So, building a small AI team from scratch and \nscaling it up upon success will  pay off in the long run. Hence, the first \nthing companies must consider is the hiring of an exceptional AI leader \nso to let him/her build his/her AI team. No matter the titles the AI team \nleaders wear, they are the only ones able to attract, motivate and retain \nAI talent around them.  Of course , developing an in -house Data/AI func-\ntion to create a source of competitive advantage takes time.  \nDespite that growing an AI team following a slow -paced strategy may \nsound counterintuitive compared to the overwhelming  volume of data at \nreach, experience tells that AI teams addressing many problem state-\nments in parallel is totally inefficient. AI is the result of forward and back-\nward thinking that is intrinsic to any learning process leading to superior \nknowledge. So, g iven one problem statement to solve at a time, I strongly \nrecommend letting the AI team dive deep into the data and only ascend \nwhile consolidating the learnings, like scuba divers respect decompres-\nsion stops. Moreover, the development of good performing A I/ML mod-\nels cannot easily accommodate software coding sprints so agile meth-\nodologies are not deem ed appropriate for AI teams to adopt.  \nLikely, the above explains why big tech companies are acquiring \nsmall but highly specialized AI companies to faster merg e their teams \nwhile incorporating new functional knowledge  and thus accelerating AI. \nThe impact of high -growth strateg ies that big tech companies are expe-\nriencing is that they are falling fast into commoditized AI products and \nservices that do not differentiate from each other. The lack of technology \nchallenges could explain why the retention of talent in AI is becoming \nincreasingly difficult and only the lure of large salaries seems to be the \nalternative that Big Tech  companies  have, thus creating an excessive \nturnover and wage inflation.     \nJordi Guitart, PhD  has been recently appoi nted CEO of the Barcelona -based healthtech \nstartup Science4Tech Solutions, coming from Aizon where he served as VP of AI.

The application of ML has \nalready generated multi -billion USD in consumer markets (e.g., online \nmarketing and content recommendations) and ML is well on its way to \ntransform ing traditional \u2018non-AI\u2019 and \u2018non-data driven \u2019 industries. By ad-\ndressing the following three topics, the board and executive leadership \nmay benefit in making the right decisions.  \n- How do AI and data -driven technology change a conventional com-\npany\u2019s market position? This is an impor tant question as a conven-\ntional company could be directly and immediately affected by com-\npetitors that use AI more effectively than they do. The size of this \nthreat needs to be assessed while taking into consideration what is \nhype and what is real. If a ma rket changes over a longer period then \nthis is often due to long cycles of product introduction in a particular \nindustry (e.g. the pharmaceutical and car industry). In these long -cy-\ncle industries, regulations and new frame works  will take time to put \ninto a ction , but when they are , it often opens a flood gate of new prod-\nucts, and it is important to be ready when that happens.  \n- How can AI and data -driven technolog ies add value to its products, ser-\nvices , and operations?  There are at least three AI value genera tors in \na company: AI can improve existing products and services , AI can cre-\nate a new portfolio of products and services , or AI can make opera-\ntions more efficient and effective . Operational improvement is often \nthe initial way for a conventional company to  create value as the op-\nerations do not affect the main value creation of their business \u2013 it is, \nhowever, often a more conservative path . In operational practice, AI \ncan improve processes, such as logistics and supply chain, sales , and \nIT processes much of  which resides in ERP and CRM systems. The \ncompany\u2019s services and products will then be created more effec-\ntively and efficiently, hence keeping the company competitive. In this \nconte xt, it is worth mentioning the well -known \u2018productivity paradox \u2019, \nwhere a new technology does not seem to have a measurable ROI, \nthat has an impact on the bottom or top line of the business. How-\never , the introduction of AI keeps a company competitive, meaning \nthat they can continue to build and sell their products and services \nunder competitive operations. Successes might then result in spillo-\nvers into the first and second AI value generators mentioned above.  \n- How to assess the risk and cost of introducing AI technolog ies that \nbring wide implications on products, services , and operations ?

A low -risk approach often \nresults in smaller mar ket shares, less growth , and less future revenue, \nand that path is often chosen if AI technology is not well understood. \nDeep knowledge of AI in the board and executive leadership is valua-\nble in predicting market developments and identify ing what changes \nneed to take place in the company.  \nThese are tough questions, but as history has shown , companies that \nunderstand how new technology changes a market and adapt sufficiently \nquick ly will prevail over those that do not. This has been the case with \nthe steam engine, transistor, internet , and electricity. The need to under-\nstand and adapt will be  no different for a business in the age of AI. \nEach board and executive leadership will respond to the above ques-\ntions differently, and influence a company\u2019s path in their own way. How-\never, there are three considerations that can help to address the above.   \n- Ensure that there is d eep subject expertise for an adequate under-\nstanding of AI in the context of your  company\u2019s future success.  Exec-\nutive leaders and board members should interact with the smartest \nand most suitable AI leader s in the company as much as possible to \ngain a comprehensive understanding of what AI can do for the busi-\nness. Such a leader has a PhD in AI and a strong business acumen. \nThis will help to identify which business direction to take and what is \ntechnologically feasible. In short, hire the best AI talent that you can \nget your hands on.  \n- Ensure f ull awareness of the strength and weaknesses of the com-\npany\u2019s existing product and service portfolio . Conventional business \nleadership is often caught up in group think where everyone agre es \nthat \u201cour business has been good so far, so let 's do more of the same \na little bit better, and we will be fine\u201d. This is harmful to a company\u2019s \nadaption of new market conditions. Hence, create an open space for \ntransformational possibilities for your  company\u2019s future.  \n- Create meaning for key stakeholders in times of change . Initial AI pro-\njects or products should aim to be meaningful , rather than impactful , \nfor as many stakeholders as possible. \u2018Meaning \u2019 here suggests that \nthe application of AI in the business ma kes integral sense to key \nstakeholders that are often resistant to organizational change. These \nstakeholders can be middle management, employees, and sharehold-\ners who  are sometimes not convinced of the value that  new technol-\nogy can generate (particularly when their own department or job is \nperceived to be under threat). For those stakeholders, the outcome of \nan AI initiative needs to meet a wide range of minimal accept able - \nand often intangible - criteria.

This framework  should include the methodologies, organi-\nzational principles , and technologies that, when combined, can bring to a \ncompany  all the needed capabilities , at scale.  We use this framework to \nanalyze the organization from a strategic, organizational, and operational \npoint of view  - we seek to inject Data, use AI and bring innovation into all \nkey processes , and align the efforts among the different areas.  \nTo become a data and AI -powered organization, the end -to-end trans-\nformation must permeate all organizational layers from the C -level and \nsenior managers through out the hi erarchy . Each level has a critical role \nto play in this transformation  journey . For instance, t he CEO is responsi-\nble for defining the strategic lines and set ting the corporate objectives \nregarding the use of data and AI.  The HR team communicates and evan-\ngelizes the  new \u2018data mission \u2019 as designed from the C-level , and pro-\nmote s a culture that emphasizes the use of  data . The latter can be \nachieved  by introducing  training and literacy programs  and certifications ; \nor by encouraging  access to the open ecosystem to keep up to date with \nthe latest developments and new trends related to data and AI.  \nIn parallel, business functions play a key role, as they are expected to \ncreate  value through innovative use cases that leverage Data and AI  and \nbring  together  operational , industry , and technology expertise . To imple-\nment solutions that support these use cases, business functions  need to \ncollaborat e with technology teams \u2013 to build and scale data -driven solu-\ntions.  Ideally, t he first use cases to implement should have low complex-\nity but a high return on investment . This helps obtain support from stake-\nholders  and demonstrat e the value  of the technology  and also helps drive \nthe demand and readiness for more ambitious  data -driven  use cases \nacross the organization.  \nBesides fostering multidisciplinary teams and promoting synergies \nbetween business areas, an AI -driven organization must establish  train-\ning programs  that help develop further the internal Data & AI talent. These \nprograms  also help  to develop an innovation culture that permeates all \nareas, departments , and teams . Training also  help s in spread ing the AI \nknowledge across teams and enabling  the organization to stay ahead of \nthe market trends and experiment with the latest tech advancements. \nThrough such literacy programs , the company  can redefine itself as a \nmore attractive organization . \nA successful AI -powered organization  also needs the right structure . \nShaping  the right organization is one of the most challenging problems a \ncompany can face .

But how to achieve differenti-\nation from the competition when any company out there can access \nproductized AI  e.g. pre -trained industry -specific services such as Natural \nLanguage Processing  or Computer Vision , etc. ? Part of the strategy could \nbe to not only pursue partnerships  with leading big tech companies  but \nalso  to adopt open -source AI frameworks  that offer ready -to-use technol-\nogies and architectures .

It could also intro duce a new working model \nacross the AI lifecycle: data scientists reuse standardized components \nand refocus from dull, repetitive tasks, to creating real business value \nthrough AI.  \nOnce a company has adopted the culture and the technology, it is \nthen nece ssary to think how the y can use that combination to stand out \nfrom their competition.

That is the point in time, most organizations start (or should start) \nexploring AI.  \nAs AI needs data a s fuel, it only makes sense that these two functions \n(Data and AI) are located close together within the org chart.  To take this \na step further, while AI usage is in its own exploration phase, it would \nmake sense for AI to be part of the Data function as w ell. So at least in \nthe beginning, we should be talking about a Data & AI Team.  \nAs this Data & AI Team matures over time  and has produced a solid \nData Strategy , the balance within the team will change  from having Data \nEngineers as the majority to having Data Scientists, ML Researchers , and \nEngineers as the majority.   \nOnce the organization has reached the state of data democratization, \nthen it should shift to a more agile structure, where AI roles from the Data \n& AI team will be rolled into the various product/service teams, opera-\ntional teams , and so on, to deliver their expertise as part of a team with \nend-to-end responsibility.

The most common supervised \nlearning algorithms are classification and regression.

Semi -supervised algorithms only need a few labelled train-\ning samples and they are currently a hot research area.

There are multiple NLP applica tions such as sentiment analy-\nsis, information extraction , and machine translation. Transformers (such \nas GPT -33 and BERT4) have been widely used. Transformers have a loop-\ning mechanism that acts as a highway to allow information to flow from \none step to the next and retain sequential memory. This makes them \nideal for speech recognition, language translation , and stock predictions. \nState -of-the-art (SOTA) transformers for NLP tasks can be found at mul-\ntiple open -source Github repositories5. \nAnother AI sub -field is Computer Vision - often referred to as Machine \nPerception. The goal of these algorithms is to enable computers to visu-\nalize the world as humans do. The most widely adopted Computer Vision \nproblem is object  recognition in 2D and 3D d ata. There are multiple tasks \ninvolved with image recognition such as image classification, segmenta-\ntion, and object detection. Some of the most commonly used Convolu-\ntional Neural Networks for object detection are YOLOv36 and deep resid-\nual networks7 with  the SOTA being Vision Transformers8.  \nDecision -making is another complex task that involves data analysis \nand merging information from disparate sources while leveraging infor-\nmation importance.

Some of these include explainability of the devel-\noped models (technical challeng e), algorithmic bias (technical and soci-\netal challenge), and transparency in usage (societal, political , and legal \nchallenge). Quantum computing can assist in mitigating some of these \nobstacles. It can be used to rapidly train and generate optimized ML al-\ngorithms  (using superposition and entanglement) . A recent open -source \nlibrary for quantum ML is Tensorflow Quantum (TFQ)9 which combines a \nsuite of quantum modelling and Machine Learning tools. Some contribu-\ntions of Quantum AI are: quick and optimal weight  selection of neural \nnetworks, faster encryption based on quantum search , and quantum al-\ngorithms based on the Hamiltonian time evolution that represent prob-\nlems with optimal decision trees faster than random walks. A summary \nof AI models, papers, datasets , and open -source libraries can be found at \nStateoftheart.ai10.  \nThe evolution of AI spanning across disciplines has been inspired by \nadvances in biology, cognition , and system theories. The next break-\nthroughs will not only give machines more logical reason ing capabilities \nbut also the possibility of surpass ing human senses for the better of hu-\nmanity.  \nDr. Eva Agapaki  is the Director of the Digital Twins research lab at the University of \nFlorida with experience in applied machine learning projects in academia and industry.  \nDIMA TURCHYN   \nArtificial Intelligence Product Marketing Lead, CEE Region   \nMICROSOFT \u2022 CZECHIA  \nDuring the latest several years, I \u2019ve witnessed various  interesting \ntrends in AI systems available on the market t hat solve real -life use \ncases.

Those large models come at  a \ncost though, since they require a large pool of resources and are only \nbecoming popular due to the availability of powerful optimization and \ndistribution learning algorithms. For example, the abovementioned Meg-\natron -Turing NLG model leverages the DeepSpeed library, allowing to \nbuild pipeline parallelism  to scale model training across nodes. By the \nway, cost (including environmental) to train  such large -scale models \nmeans that effective re -use of those models across use cases is key for \ngaining positive net value.  And, at the same time, those same powerfu l \nlibraries, next generation algorithms , and cloud resources are available \nto literally anyone: as an example, using those same libraries and the \ncloud ML platform allowed one of our customers \u2013 the University of Pecs \nin Hungary \u2013 to train Hungarian langua ge model in just several months \nfrom idea to production, with total resources cost of just around $1000.  \nAnother interesting observation is the emergence of models which \nare multi -task, multi -language, or models that are built for one domain of \nAI tasks and then are  successfully applied to another. For example, ap-\nplying attention models initially developed for NLP to image recognition \ntasks shows impressive results. And even more so, new models emerge \nwhich learn simultaneously on different type s of modalit ies \u2013 or multi-\nmodal architectures. Most prominent are probably recent architectures \nthat use a combination of language and image data  \u2013 they learn from \nboth the objects in an image and the corresponding text  - leading to \nknowledge  that can be applied to a range of tasks , from classification to \ngenerating image description or even translation or image generation.  \nThis paradigm of combining narrow learning tasks into a more gen-\neral model which learns on many tasks simultaneously is also leveraged", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2453, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba080158-f44f-4ae0-a6ee-9f38a5716952": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba080158-f44f-4ae0-a6ee-9f38a5716952", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "268fdb4f-bd5b-4a0b-85f1-f11ae8c64423", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "0613f6472b1146a99ee0d3d287244ed31ffa0ab3f3005cdc9efec860d40fdb93"}}, "hash": "08dd69f71b10be8119319b6a1a44d3f996674a69da7d5dadd67d85b1eaeccace", "text": "What is the \u2018AI State of the Art\u2019?  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 96 - \n in the new generation of Language Models. As an example, Z -code mod-\nels take advantage of shared linguistic elements across multiple lan-\nguages to improve the quality of machine translation and other language \nunderstanding tasks. Those models take advantage of both tra nsfer \nlearning and multitask learning from monolingual and multilingual data \nto create a language model, improving tasks like machine translation by \na significant margin across languages.  This same approach is used in \nFlorence 1.0 model, which uses XYZ -code, a joint representation of three \ncognitive attributes: monolingual text (X), audio or visual sensory signals \n(Y), and multilingual (Z), which allowed to advance multi -task, multi -lin-\ngual Computer Vision services for tasks like zero -shot image classifica-\ntion, image/text retrieval, object detection , and question answering.  \nThere are of course many other models and developments, which \npush the boundaries of what is possible with ML models. Working with \nthe customers and partners on their AI projects, what I am always looking \nfor is how we can apply all of that state -of-the-art research to real-life \ncustomer projects. Using a large -scale model has its challenges from its \nsize to inference costs  and many approaches emerge to build sparser, \nmore efficient models. As an example, the abovementioned Z -code mod-\nels use a \u2018mixture of experts \u2019 approach, which means only a portion of a \nmodel is being engaged to comp lete a task. As a result, customers can \nmake  use of those powerful developments almost immediately after its \nintroduction. Customers can today build applications leveraging Z -code \nmodels, or use multilingual language models with Cognitive Services \nAPIs, or even apply powerful large -scale models like  Open AI as a man-\naged cloud service.  \nIn general, this is probably the most impactful observation I record \nfor myself in the latest couple of years: not only new models emerge, but \nthose new generation models are also significantly decreasing the cycle \nfrom introduction to actual, applied implementations. This has its obvi-\nous benefits, but also imposes significant risks. For example, the latest \nspeech generation services  are available to anyone as easy -to-use API s \nalong with many other AI services now reach ing human parity . This gen-\neral availability increases the need to take  responsibility for how those \nservices are being applied. This is a separate topic by itself, as ap-\nproaches to address those risks span across cultural, technological , and \npolicy dimensi ons, like gating some of the services and reviewing the use \ncase each time those services are being deployed, helping to ensure that \nthose powerful advancements are applied not only where it can be used, \nbut where it actually should be.  \nDima Turchyn  is working with analytical technologies and Machine Learning for 20+ \nyears and has a broad background in Business Development, IT and Marketing.

One such cutting -edge  application is the use of AI to \noptimally orchestrate large complex systems, in -particular global supply \nchains. Supply chains are systems that are not just complicated, but \ncomplex as they have many individual legs or components with contra-\ndictory incent ives.

Here we may use commercial tool s to understand how \nthe system is configured as a starting poi nt for our model. We may then \npull on another active area of AI, time -series forecasting.

Additionally, in complex systems we are often con-\nsidering multiple forecasts, solutions such as LightGBM that sup port hi-\nerarchical forecasting are therefore beneficial.  \nOther AI technologies whose outputs may be included in complex \nsystem s are Deep Learning applications such as Computer Vision or \nNLP. Here we see rapid innovation on a different trajectory. The scaling \nof models and available training sets that have been made widely availa-\nble by technology companies such as Google and non -profits such as \nImageNet , has led to commoditisation  of Computer Vision applications. \nThere are now numerous off -the-shelf solutions that can be applied to \nreal-world problems with relatively small amounts of customisation . This \nis feasible  via Transfer Learning , that is, the process of using  a pre -\ntrained model as a starting point for a model for a new task. For example, \nyour starting model may be able to identify dogs in a photo, you can then \nadditionally train it to identify your pet among others, similarly to how Ap-\nple and Meta can start to quickly recog nise your friends in photos. For \nexample, say we want to use Computer Vision to measure quality on the \nmanufacturing line, we can very quickly build a good proof of concept \nusing offerings such as Microsoft\u2019s Cognitive Services or Google\u2019s Au-\ntoML.  \nWe then need to use optimisers to build our scenarios and solve the \nproblem. Here again , there are many different solutions available.  \nSearching the problem space and optimising for solutions in complex \nsystems is a big problem and can quickly become computationa lly ex-\npensive. It\u2019s an area where Quantum computing holds great potential and \ncould cause a real step -change, in particular Quantum Annealing. This \nrefers to an optimisation process for finding the global minimum of an \nobjective function, particularly effe ctive when there are many local min-\nima, such as across our complex supply chain.  \nFinally, supply chains are also areas where developments in the gov-\nernance of AI, accountability of model recommendations , and model \ntransparency and explainability are very i mportant. Unlike many digital/ \nweb applications of AI, we are faced with the challenge of how to \u2018start \nsmall \u2019 when innovating & testing a model that may e.g. deploy a shipping \ncontainer full of product s. Supply chain scenarios require high confi-\ndence in m odels when applying recommendations to a real -world system \nfor the first time. The implications of errors can be significant, particularly \nin highly regulated supply chains where there are safety requirements  on \nthe quality of the output.

They put the two networks \nagainst each other in order to generate new, synthetic instances of \ndata that can pass for real data or as real data. The most popular \nexample of its use is Deep -Fake, which can manipulate videos so that \nthey look real and are hard to distinguish from reality.  \n- Recurrent Neural Networks  (RNNs) and the sub-type Long -Short \nTerm Memory Networks (LSTMs ) are a special typ e of artificial Neu-\nral Network adapted to work for time series data  or data that involves \nsequences . Those types of algorithms consider the missing dimen-\nsion of time in CNNs and keep the data\u2019s history.

We use ma-\nchines to augment our limited physical strength, endurance, memory, and \ncomputing capability. However, until recently, there were no machines t o \naugment our decision -making capability. Hence, most of the high -paying \njobs in the post -industrial era involve skilled labor that requires substan-\ntial decision -making. Only the most mundane and mindless tasks are au-\ntomated by mechanical machines. Yet, ma ny of these machines still re-\nquire human operators to make decisions, whether it\u2019s as complex as \ndriving a truck, or simply deciding when to switch a machine on and off.  \nPerhaps, we\u2019ll need a new econ-\nomy that is driven by maximiz-\ning happiness rather than \nprofit.  \n- Dr. Michael Wu  \nToday, as AI -based technologies become more pervasive, machines \ncan augment our cognitive capacity and automate our complex decision -\nmaking processes for the first time. This will dramatically change the way \nwe work, leading to the Fourth Industrial Revolution1. Many tasks that \nwere reserved for humans and require some level of human decisions, \ncan be automated as long as we can collect enough data to train an AI to \nmimic those human decisions and actions.  \nOne of the most significa nt benefits of AI is the huge efficiency it \nbrings.

As with any machine automation, AI can \neliminate careless human errors, and provide greater consistency in our \ncomplex decision -making processes.  \nIndividuals can benefit tremendously from AI because it can elimi-\nnate the mundan e and repetitive tasks that nobody likes to do. Whether \nit\u2019s something as simple as deciding which movie to watch, adding items \nto our shopping list or having them delivered automatically, or getting \nhome safely and quickly, AI can automate these tasks, al lowing us to \nspend our valuable time on more important things. Not only do we get \nconvenience and save time, but also, we get better and more personal-\nized experiences.  \nNow let\u2019s expand our scope and look at AI\u2019s impact on businesses. \nToday, many enterprise s, especially large ones, have many inefficient or \nsimply broken business processes (e.g. in customer service). These in-\nefficiencies have many negative side -effects on the business, as they of-\nten result in higher operating costs (e.g. hiring more staff).

Fixing the inefficiencies in business can indirectly \ncut costs and improve customer experience. But beyond that, businesses \ncan also improve their customer experience directly using personaliza-\ntion AI (e.g. recommender systems) and create more engaging brand in-\nteractions via conversational AI (e.g. chatbots and virtual assistants).  \nUnlike consumer AI tools that automate simple everyday decisions, \nbusiness AI can be trained to automate decisions  that are often highly \ntechnical, domain -specific, and have a much lower tolerance for error. \nBusiness AI is much less known to the consumers because they are often \nused by highly specialized experts.

As companies and individuals strive to realize greater efficiency \nfrom AI, our society as a whole will also function more efficiently. Since \nthe first industrial revolution, we have spent less an d less time at work. If \nthis trend continues, maybe in the not too distant future, AI automation \ncould allow our society to function so efficiently that it can support a Uni-\nversal Basic Income (UBI)2. Perhaps, we will no longer need to work for \nsurvival, but instead, we work because we want to, for the passion, the \nexperience, and the sense of fulfillment.  \nClearly, we are not there yet! Today, our AI systems are only capable \nof learning from specific data sources and automating point decisions in \na narrow  domain (i.e. Artificial Narrow Intelligence, ANI3). However, since \ntechnological progress occurs at an exponential rate, it won\u2019t be too long \nuntil AI matches human intelligence (i.e. Artificial General Intelligence, \nAGI4) or even surpasses it (i.e. Artificial Superintelligence, ASI5). When \nthis happens, ASI could potentially rewrite themselves to make them \neven more intelligent. This positive feedback of intelligence would grow \nindefinitely, leading to more and more world -changing innovations at an \nincreasing rate. Humans simply cannot adapt to those rapid and dra-\nmatic changes, let alone the existential threat of an ASI. This uncontrol-\nlable technological explosion is often referred to as technological singu-\nlarity6.  \nAlthough the looming singularity is frightening, It\u2019s unfruitful to spec-\nulate about a knowingly unpredictable future that\u2019s far away. Stemming \nfrom the mass adoption of AI, there are already many societal challenges \nthat we must deal with long before we re ach the singularity. As AI auto-\nmates more human work in a market society driven by competition and \nprofit maximization, it\u2019s inevitable that companies will reduce their hu-\nman workforce to cut costs. What will humans do then? Perhaps, we\u2019ll \nneed a new econo my in the future that is driven by maximizing happiness \nrather than profit.  \nSince AI advancements progress at an exponential rate, it will be chal-\nlenging to retrain and upskill the human workforce fast enough for them \nto keep stable jobs.

Some inequality is good, as it not only motivates people \nbut also enables lar ge-scale projects that require huge investments. \nHowever, too much inequality is definitely bad, as it leads to more crime, \nreduces social mobility, and undermines the fairness and trust of social \ninstitutions .  \nSince the efficiency gained from \nAI is huge,  the inequality it cre-\nates is also extreme.  \n- Dr. Michael Wu  \nWhat about the looming singularity and the existential threat? If you \nmust squeeze a comment out of me on this matter, consider this: All AI \nsystems learn from data. But these training data are c reated by humans, \nas they are digital records of our past actions and encapsulate our past \ndecisions. So AI is really learning from us, humans, and AI will mimic our \ndecision processes.  \nTherefore, if we do run into a situation where our interests are in c on-\nflict with AI, the best way to ensure that AI doesn\u2019t destroy us is for us to \nbe better role models for AI now. That means we, as a human race, must \nlearn to not kill each other whenever we run into conflicts. In short, the \nbest way to ensure our own sur vival is for us to be better humans. We \nmust learn to be more compassionate, more empathic, more environ-\nmentally conscious, etc. So our decisions and action can be used to train \nan AGI (or ASI) that mimics these \u2018better -human\u2019 qualities.  \n \n7 Gerhard Lenski - Wikiwand", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2215, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a61e46a5-64ff-43a0-8132-04f8401acc9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a61e46a5-64ff-43a0-8132-04f8401acc9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d0ae829-436e-4ea5-9950-d728933e2c9c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "4f6e22cdd56d64da15ea94056ce373372eeea0c769340766e935bbc872e4f553"}}, "hash": "932ed05ad439dd004a75edb50e163721ec2e6cbd298ed4c6de83b6833abf47f5", "text": "The impact  of AI on societ y and everyday life  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 108 - \n This may sound imp ossible in today\u2019s society because we must com-\npete and struggle for survival, which often brings out the worst of our \nhuman nature.

Holistic interconnection  means that everything i n our lives will even-\ntually be digitally enabled and thereafter interconnected in a true In-\nternet of Everything (IoE) manner.

Ubiquitous awareness  means that AI systems \u2013 built atop holistic in-\nterconnection \u2013 will become fully aware of each person, of personal \nand societal infrastructure, and of how these are all interacting with \neach other \u2013 and will then make decisions and take actions on our \nbehalf that benefit society in a range of ways.  One can imagine the \nsituation where \u2013 upon approaching their office building or a shop-\nping mall \u2013 that facility becomes fully \u2018aware\u2019 of their presence (in-\ncluding their identi ty \u2013 and that of everyone else there), where they \ncurrently are in the environment, where their assets (car, laptop, etc.) \nare in the environment, and how the environment can best accommo-\ndate their needs by learning new insights about them, like their pre-\nferred office lighting and temperature, or the promotions being run at \nstores they fr equent, and so on \u2013 all in a way that optimizes the whole, \nlike overall energy consumption for example.  Eventually, everywhere \nwe go, our environments will be completely aware of us, and will, via \nAI, optimize the environment for us. In many ways, AI will come to \nknow more about us and our patterns than we ourselves understand \n(in some places it already does).  One important implication of holistic \ninterconnection and ubiquitous awareness is that society\u2019s notion of \n\u2018privacy\u2019 will have to change \u2013 to one tha t is far more comfortable \nwith having individual data shared openly across systems. In due \ntime, this societal norm will shift, and the conversations around pri-\nvacy in future generations will look very different from those of the \npresent generation.  \n3. Substi tutionary automation  means that AI will empower numerous \nautomated systems to become fully autonomous in their operation, \nand consequently be able to deliver value without  the need for human \noversight or intervention. Clear examples of this are fully auton omous \nvehicles and transportation systems, fully automated business pro-\ncesses, and fully autonomous professional services (like legal and \naccounting services for example).  Substitutionary automation means \nthat many tasks that presently consume (waste) our time \u2013 like rou-\ntine driving, routine data processing, and so on \u2013 can all be relin-\nquished to automated systems and consequently free us up to focus \nour time, energy, and efforts on more creative and novel tasks \u2013 tasks \nfor which the human mind is best suit ed. \n4. Knowledge creation  refers to something that AI has already started \nto do, namely synthesize new knowledge that did not exist previously \n(usually via adaptive pattern recognition) \u2013 interconnecting points of \ninsight that were previously unconnected.

By introducing algorithmic logic, we can make sure that \nhuman frailty isn\u2019t driving the big decisions that society needs to take.  \nThat said, we often forget that AI has both s hort and long -term im-\npacts on society. Looking at things in the short term, it may well look like \nAI is nothing but a net positive for society. AI can help us sort out issues \nsuch as suboptimal urban planning, or deal with racial bias in sentencing \ndecisio ns. It can help clarify the impact of credit scores, or ensure that \nthe mood of a doctor doesn\u2019t affect a medical diagnos is. What unites \nthese cases  is that it is very easy to spot bias or errors in the way the AI \nfunctions. An AI that does urban planning in a way that marginalizes cer-\ntain ethnic groups will be found out and an AI that misdiagnoses cancer \nwill be caught. These are all cases of what I have called \u2018short bias \u2019, errors \nthat algorithmic logic can get caught in through insufficient data or bad \ntraining.  \nBut what about those cases where an AI influences decisions that \nhave long trajectories, and where the impact might not be known for \nyears or decades? Imagine that an AI is programmed to figure out which \nof four new research paths in energy produ ction should be supported and \nfinanced. One is known and tested, two are cutting edge but with great \npotential, and the last one is highly speculative. Unless the AI has been \nprogrammed to take great risks, it is likely to suggest that the speculative \nprog ram is cut. Yet, we know that many speculative ideas \u2013 antibiotics, \nthe internet, and female suffrage come to mind \u2013 have turned out to be \nsome of the best ideas we\u2019ve ever had.  \nWhat is at play here is something I have given the name \u2018long bias \u2019, \ni.e. the issue of potential long -term negative consequences from AI deci-\nsions that are difficult to discern in the here and now. AI is exceptionally \ngood at handling issues where the parameters are known \u2013 whether a \ncat is a cat, or whether a tumor is a tumor. Thes e are also issues where \nhumans can quickly spot the errors of an AI.

The benefits of AI \nin our society are tremendous and cannot be listed in a few paragraphs, \nbut here are three categories that I fe el AI impacts the most.  \n1. Enhancing our Throughput as professionals . Have you heard of the \nterm throughput before? Investopedia defines it as \u201cthe amount of a \nproduct or service that a company can produce and deliver to a client \nwithin a specified period of  time\u201d. According to Accenture, AI might \nincrease productivity by 40% by 2035. This statement makes perfect \nsense to me, as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning empower \nus both personally and professionally, to avoid tedious day -to-day \ntasks. Imagi ne a world where you could only focus on the most stra-\ntegic, most creative, and most impactful tasks at work, instead of \nspending your time i.e. troubleshooting a permission issue on your \nwork laptop or crafting the right email to the right person with the  right \nwording.

We may even get told by an AI what tasks \nshould matter the most, according to our personal goals.  \n2. Enhancing Our Life . I worked for many years on Speech technologies \nfor smart devices at home. Being able to use your voice and instruct \nyour home devices to perform certain day -to-day tasks (i.e. playing \nmusic at home, setting a timer, retrieving an email or playing a pod-\ncast, or even turnings lights on or off) instead of needing to use a \nkeyboard or a phone, creates a sense of convenience and luxury that \nwas previously unimaginab le. AI can also help automatically monitor \nyour home for intruders and also reduce energy usage.  \n3. Healthcare . AI can improve, simplify and even save lives. Machines \nnever get tired and thus are less likely to make a mistake compared \nto humans. There are many studies about how AI can reduce error \nand diagnose health issues effectively and efficiently, for example be-\ning able to diagnose cancer earlier than traditional ways. Moreover, \nkey technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) have \nnumerous a pplications in healthcare as they can classify, retrieve im-\nportant documentation, and provide actionable insights in a matter of \nseconds.  \nMarily Nika  is an AI Product Leader based in San Francisco working for Google, previ-\nously for Meta (Facebook).

AI is changing the way we live our lives in \nmany ways and has the potential to be a game -changer for many indus-\ntries. Some of the benefits of AI are that it can  take on repetitive tasks, it \ncan handle tasks that are complex and require human intelligence, and it \ncan help humans make better decisions. AI is already being used in many \nindustries such as healthcare, education, finance, law enforcement, and \ntransportation.  \nThe next generation of AI is expected to do more than just provide \ninsights and suggestions.

It's often seen as an object of fear, with \npeople worried about what AI might do to the human  race. Some people \nworry about what will happen if AI becomes too powerful and can make \ndecisions on its own without human interference. Other people worry \nabout how AI can be used as a weapon, such as in warfare.   \nOther challenges of AI include the lack o f ethics. We need to make \nsure that AI is not being used for evil purposes. AI is also not perfect and \nit has its flaws . For example, t here are many cases where AI has been \nfound biased towards certain races, genders, and other social identities. \nThere is also the issue of privacy : We need to ensure that AI does not \ninvade our privacy or violate our rights as humans.  \nThe idea of AI taking over the world is not new, but the idea that hu-\nmans will be able to control it is. However , it is  not just about being a ble \nto control it ; it is also about being able to understand how it works and \nwhat its limitations are. We need to trust AI if we want it to trust us back. \nFirst and foremost, we need to make sure that we are , not only aware of \nthe risks that AI poses but also able to address these risks  \u2013 and here \nare some ways in which we can do so : \n1. We can work on having a clear understanding of what AI is and what \nit is capable of so that we know how it will affect us in the future.  \n2.

AI has the potential to help us solve many \nof the world\u2019s most pressing problems, includin g controlling pandemics, \npoverty, climate change, and hunger.  \nWe must  be careful not to cre-\nate a future where we are all \nworking for robots or AI beings . \n- Nazar Zaki  \nThe future of AI is bright and we should not worry about it too much. \nAI will help us get  better at everything we do and make our lives easier in \nmany ways.

Often though AI raises societal concerns around safety and se-\ncurity, privacy, inequality, discrimination, and bias in fundamental rights \nand democracy. Depending on the data it uses, AI could lead to biased \ndecisions when it comes to ethnicity, gende r, or age in the context of hir-\ning processes, banking, or even the justice system. For these reasons, \ndeployers of AI systems should ensure equality, diversity, inclusion, and \nresponsible use of AI to avoid potential pitfalls to society.  \nArtificial Intelligence can solve \nsocietal challenges and reduce \nclimate change.  \n- Angeliki Dedopoulou  \nIf AI is used responsibly, it can create significant benefits to the \nglobal arena. It  can solve societal challenges and reduce climate change, \nand reinforce initiatives like the European Green Deal and Paris Agree-\nment. AI can also contribute to the realization of the sustainable and de-\nvelopment goals of the United Nations and it can play a  crucial role in \ncurbing global issues such as:  \n- Control of epidemics . During a global pandemic, governments\u2019 initial \nobjective is to minimize the spread of the disease. If AI is fed by his-\ntorical data, it can recognize patterns and trends, and then via pr edic-\ntive analysis, it can lead to necessary measures to eliminate the \nspread of the virus. AI can also be used to accelerate the develop-\nment of vaccines related to viruses.  \n- Management and control of pollution . Pollution is a global challenge \nthat concerns  all countries around the world. AI can be used for the \nprotection of the environment and pollution control. More specifi-\ncally, AI systems contribute to the detection of energy emission re-\nductions, the removal of CO2, the monitoring and prediction of ex-\ntreme weather conditions, and support the development of greener \ntransportation networks.  \n- Global food crisis prevention .

AI -based solu-\ntions can create systems that warn governments on food shortages \nand prepare them for better food supply and management. AI solu-\ntions can also help farmers t o produce more food with less land. For \nexample, AI -enabled operations are estimated to use roughly 90% \nless water and produce over 20 times more food per acre than tradi-\ntional fields10.  \n- Water pollution management . UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goal 6 \nseek s to ensure that people have access to clean water and adequate \nsanitation services worldwide. AI can be used to reduce pollutants in \nthe water and detect the amount and composition of toxic contami-\nnants. AI can also increase the efficiency of waste manage ment sys-\ntems.  \nFor businesses, AI can enable important sectors such as tourism, \nconstruction, agriculture, green and circular economy. It can also im-\nprove the quality of products, increase production levels, and contribute \nto energy savings. For example:  \n- When customer service representative s in a hotel are not available, \nAI bots may respond to questions and provide useful information.  \n- In the construction sector, AI can improve project efficiency and the \nsafety of workers in construction sites.  \n- Smart farming is helping the agriculture sector to be more profitable. \nAI-powered mechanisms can monitor aspects such as grain mass \nflow, the quality of harvested grains, and moisture content.  \n- AI in combination with intelligent grid systems and deep predictive \nmodels  can manage the demand and supply of renewable energy.  \n \nTo conclude, AI has a huge potential to benefit societies and boost \nmany sectors of the economy. However, governments need to ensure \nthat AI prioritizes humans, reinforce human\u2019s trust, protect human r ights, \nand promote creativity and empathy. Policymakers should create a \nglobal dialogue, explain, educate, and boost transparency of AI, adapt \ntraining and education curricula to the new Artificial Intelligence society, \nand promote, develop and encourage t he public and private sectors to \nadopt human -centered and trustworthy AI.  \nAngeliki Dedopoulou  is Public Policy Manager for AI & Fintech at Meta ( formerly known \nas Facebook ).

We seem to have rea ched a point in time where \nmost progress in AI will come from focusing on data and thinking about \nhow we evaluate the AI models' performance rather than improving AI \narchitectures or hardware. I am not saying that there is no room for im-\nprovement there, bu t I feel that the real breakthroughs will happen around \nhow we improve our data and the questions we want AI to answer.  \nI am a big fan of the work Andrew Ng11 does with the website \ndeeplearning.ai12 both in providing great educational material in AI and \nmore importantly to highlight the importance of data -driven development \nof AI models. My background is in instrumentation and measurement \ntechnology and, therefore, I am a big believer that if you do not collect the \nright data there is no way of getting a s ensible output no matter how \nmuch AI you throw at the problem. There are also other great references \nout there on how to get more valuable input from human labelers such \nas the book by Robert Monarch titled Human -in-the-Loop Machine Learn-\ning13, describing data -driven methods of selecting better training and val-\nidation data. Finally, Stuart J. Russell proposes that we rethink how we \noptimize AI algorithms in his book Human Compatible14. \nAI and automation are already everywhere and we see great societal \nbenef its from AI, such as increased productivity and fewer human errors. \nBut, as AI becomes more ubiquitous, we also see how systematic errors \nand biases in AI models can start to cause real social and economical \nproblems. Furthermore, we have started asking ve ry deep ethical ques-\ntions when we delegate decision -making to autonomous machines. We \nhave also started running into barriers where our legal and societal \nframeworks do not manage the state of the art in AI.  \nWe currently see in our society that if AI algor ithms are not optimized \nfor the correct objectives they can start spreading misinformation and \npolarizing people on social media. This may be caused by optimizing an \nAI model for the wrong thing such as for some engagement metric and \nnot asking what such a n optimization might lead to.

In my sector, A I medical devices, we are also faced \nwith this problem where rare clinical conditions may be missed when AI \nis used inappropriately.  \nThere are also interesting societal and legal questions that have \nstarted to arise. We have started to think about who is r esponsible when \nan AI system causes an accident or harm, and how we best react when \nAI systems take over important systems in our society and take them out \nof our control, for example crashing the stock market.  \nWith all of this in mind, one quickly realize s that we need to think \nabout AI from many different angles. There are the technical and appli-\ncation aspects, but there are also ethical, societal, and legal ones  that \nmust be considered. Thus, we need a diverse group of people working on \nAI and diversity is our best chance of being successful. For people who \nare interested in being involved in AI development and adoption, I think \nthere are many great opportunities to contribute to, not only model devel-\nopment, but also to seek answers to the challenges ment ioned above.   \nJon S.

Explicit knowledge can be easily captured, codified, \nprocessed, stored , and distributed. Tacit knowledge cannot easily get \ncaptured, codified, processed, stored , and distributed  - tacit knowledge \nis accrued through experience and is explained as an ongoing accom-\nplishment through practice and participation.  \nThe problem with knowledge encoded in the AI is that it is narrow and \nbrittle, and AI systems are only reliable in a narrow topic and domain, \nwhich are predetermined, and when the topic and domain are challenged \nor changed, AI systems \u201cfall off the knowledge cliff\u201d16. Therefore, while \nAI might help for narrow, routine, predetermined tasks, it is (as yet) unre-\nliable and inaccurate to help with complex problems and decision -mak-\ning, where automation and the use of AI are yet currently impossible be-\ncause tacit knowledge cannot be easily codified17.

For example, the use of Decision Support \nSystems and \u2018big data\u2019 has limited the power of individuals in strategic \ndecision -making and has (in some instances) replaced their tacit \nknowledge, experience, and expertise on the assumption that their calcu-\nlated rationality leads to superior outcomes. For example, Fernando \nAlonso lost the 2010 Formula 1 Grand Prix Championship because the \nrace simulation algorithm provided a poor decision, and the Chief Race \nStrategist did not have the power to participate in  the decision -making or \nto change (or overrule) the decision of the algorithm, which led to Alonso \nand Ferrari losing the championship and to the Chief Race Strategist los-\ning their role18.  \nThe issue of tacit knowledge encoded in AI is also demonstrated in  \nthe challenges around the development of the decision -making algo-\nrithms for autonomous cars where decisions need to be predet ermi ned \nand context and interpretation of a situation are currently limited. There-\nfore, how AI is used needs considerable thought and consideration as in \nits current state, it does not have enough knowledge capabilities, and its \ncurrent use hampers knowledge, learning, decision -making, innovation, \nand society.  \nIn the context of a digital economy, AI and automation could advance \nthe power of the influential through control, surveillance, monitoring, dis-\ncrimination, information asymmetries, manipulation, \u2018algorithmification \u2019, \nand \u2018datafication \u2019. Such uses of AI, examples of which currently domi-\nnate, lead to exploitation, exclusion, mar ginalization, discrimination, and \nmanipulation.  \nFor example, Cambridge Analytica, which ran the American presiden-\ntial digital campaign, arguably manipulated the opinions of people and \ntheir votes or voting intentions or behaviors, through the provision of  fil-\ntered information to influence their votes. AI has been used to exploit the \npractices of people and their opinions, resulting in manipulating the vote. \nOther examples of exploitation are the automation and \u2018algorithmifica-\ntion\u2019 of influential technology  organizations that collect and exploit data, \neliminate competition, and coerce organizations to follow their algo-\nrithms19. Therefore, influential technology organizations may further con-\nsolidate and increase their power because of their technology lead ership \nand the opportunities for exploitation practices.  \n AI could lead to emancipation through empowerment, autonomy, in-\nclusion, participation, and collaboration.

As time goes by, results and research is buildi ng up \nto a very convincing argument, that AI is revolutionizing healthcare. For \nexample, from a study from the journal \u2018Annals of Oncology \u2019 from 20182, \nwe learn that in a comparison between human dermatologists and deep \nlearning, the former\u2019s success rate  was 86.6% and the latter \u2019s was 95%, \nin their ability to accurately detect skin cancer.  So, does this mean  that \nAI will replace these medical professions? Is Professor Hinton right?  \nFrom movies like the \u2018Terminator \u2019 we are inundated with the idea that \nmachines are slow ly taking over, but are we there ? Have we reached that \n\u2018apocalyptic \u2019 point of no return yet?  The answer is no. AI will help reshape \nthe way medicine s work and  will be a very useful tool for various medi cal \nspecialties like radiologists.  From helping them eliminate their backlogs \nof non -urgent cases due to COVID -19 incidents, to allowing them to be \nmore proactive in diagnosing patients\u2019 conditions. This is also proven by \nnumbers : since Professor Hinton 's prediction, the number of radiologists \n(in the US) has increased by 7% between 2016 and 2019.  \nSo, there will be no impact on employment? Is that the answer to the \nquestion?  Well , let\u2019s look at what happened in the previous revolutions \nwe discussed.  \nIn the early days of \u2018the Engine \u2019, there was so much  widespread fear \non what the impact would be, that even mobs have been attacking ven-\nues that used engines, for the fear of human labor  being replaced.  Secret \noath -based  organizations like the Luddites were forme d to fight against \nmanufacturers in the textile industry.   \nSo, what did happen? A lot of (unskilled) labor  was replaced , indeed . \nBut as production increased new labor  positions were created. From \u2018ma-\nchine operators \u2019, to \u2018machine maintenance personnel \u2019 to \u2018quality control \u2019 \nworkers at the end of the production line.  The Machine ( Engine) did re-\nplace unskilled work but  did introduce new opportunities for skilled work-\ners. \nWhat about the internet? Same here. Those impacted either adopted \nit or were  forced to adapt to it.  As a result, and as seen for the healthcare \nindustry, it will need to adopt AI and adapt to it. This explains why the \nnumber of radiologists increased, as mentioned above. The process of \ndecision -making is now easier;  hence it is at tractive to more people.  \nThe same applies to all other sectors/business domains. From the \nsupermarket commercial officer in charge of pricing who currently uses \nspreadsheets or other conventional tools to calculate what the sale price \nof product A should b e in order to increase sales but not steal from com-\npeting product B sales, to a farmer who want s more crops with fewer  \nresources, AI will be a tool to help them work more efficiently and make \nbetter decisions.  \n \n2 Man against machine: diagnostic performance of a deep learning convolutional neural network for dermo-\nscopic melanoma recognition in comparison to 58 dermat ologists - Annals of Oncology", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3152, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1b542de-d12f-498e-8c21-436a5ea2522a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1b542de-d12f-498e-8c21-436a5ea2522a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b2d8b6a4-5b2d-48b5-9f22-6fca55e51d8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "e57443fef6dc92cdd78faa67d97b0149962d9b090a7686023a4eba223d14ebf9"}}, "hash": "e56010eb758a83753c8a58e0ab397c937f48f7697f118f3bb78847b1674f055b", "text": "The impact of AI on  employment  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 132 - \n AI will require a new set of skills.

Non -technical roles start with generic noti ons like in-\ncreasing public awareness of AI. This by itself is a significant challenge  \nas it requires the presence of a basic level of technology literacy among \nthe public  - and this is where we start getting into nuances across socie-\nties. While a developed  country like Finland can easily develop a univer-\nsity-level AI course and use it to educate 1% of the population  (Finland \nbeing a country with a 100% literacy rate and where roughly 75% of the \npopulation hold a college degree), a developing country might f irst need \nto ensure that the majority of its population can read and write before \nintroducing them to something as sophisticated as AI.  \nA vital component of a society's \nreadiness for the age of AI is to \ntrain its \u2018domain experts\u2019.  \n- Golestan (Sally) Radwan  \nThe picture is not necessarily that grim, however, as evidence has \nshown that people, even those without basic access to education, are still \nable to absorb knowledge such as the use of smartphones, if a) they can \nsee the value in it, and b) if that knowle dge is presented to them in a \nmanner which suits their needs.  \nSo, going back to the Finland example, a \u2018general awareness\u2019 course \nwould simply need to be a text -based, online course in English . While  in \na developing country , the same course might need to be delivered as a \nseries of short videos on television by the country's main broadcaster,  in \na colloquial language people will understand . Moreover, it needs to be \nfull of demonstration s of how to perform certain tasks and pos sibly sup-\nported by a phone hotline to answer people's questions.  \nIt is up to each country to decide which level of general awareness \nsuits its needs. However, it is equally important for global leaders  to be \naware of those differences in needs and startin g points, and to not as-\nsume that it is equally easy for countries to implement AI awareness pro-\ngrams.

The do-\nmain expert is the non -technical professional who \u2018owns\u2019 the problem to \nbe solved by AI. Examples include healthcare professionals, agriculture \nspecialists, marketing professionals, legal experts, and many many oth-\ners depending on the domain of application of AI.

These are the individuals who will advi se on the exact problem \nto be solved, data availability, challenges, validity and relevance of re-\nsults, and many other aspects so crucial to a project's success. Training \ndomain experts is best done by introducing a compulsory \u2018Introduction \nto AI and Data Science\u2019 course into universities, or even secondary \nschools if possible. This should be tailored to each domain, for example , \n\u2018AI in Agriculture\u2019, \u2018AI in Healthcare\u2019, etc, and a version of it should be de-\nveloped for professionals currently working in that  domain. This will en-\nsure a roster of experts able to collaborate with technical teams, and \neven able to identify and suggest AI projects by themselves.  \nThe last, important group of non -technical roles are leaders, including \nthose in government, business, civil society, or any other domain. While \nthey may not need to develop the deep expertise of a domain expert, they \ndefinitely need more preparation than a general awareness course. They \nneed to be taught how to think about AI as an investment: how to ident ify \nan AI project, how to allocate the right investment, find or train the right \npeople, assess its success, and, if relevant, develop their organization's \nown AI and Data strategies. This group also includes current and aspiring \nentrepreneurs, who need to  assess their readiness to become producers \nor users/consumers of AI.  \nThe above is by no means a comprehensive capacity -building strat-\negy for AI, but rather some thoughts on how societies can start thinking \nabout developing such strategies to suit their n eeds and priorities.

For \nexample, machine learning based AI can lear n to be racist. In the US, its \njustice system, frequently faced with charges of racial bias, turned to \ntechnology to create unbiased profiles of criminals only to find that the \nalgorithms developed a racial bias. In other cases, a LinkedIn advertising \nprog ram showed a preference for male names in searches, and a Mi-\ncrosoft chatbot called Tay distributed antisemitic messages having \nspent a day learning from Twitter.  \nAI and machines are not infallible and the assumption that they will \noperate with objectivity is flawed because of both the programming re-\nquirements and the information they feed on containing inaccuracies, bi-\nases, or flaws, whether current or historical. For instance, human inter-\nvention in the training of machine learning cannot be overlooked. The  \nquality of data or information fed into the machine matters substantially \nto the quality of the outcome \u2014training is key, and volume helps, but these \ndo not overrule the need for human and societal oversight of machine \nlearning and AI and interpretations o f their outcomes to ensure the ma-\nchine or AI is not learning and absorbing incorrect information, trends, or \nperpetuates flaws originally present in data.  \nBusiness and government both have a role to play in educating soci-\nety of the usefulness and limits o f AI, but the question is who should pro-\nvide oversight? Society is a major stakeholder of AI, but society is too \ndistant and disparate to impose effective oversight or control. Therefore, \nit falls on government, business, and non -government institutions to  en-\nsure (potentially through regulation) that AI properly services the public \ngood.

The for-\nmer speaks more to the sci -fi portrayal of AI while the latter is what pow-\ners most of the leading tech today. Th e following is about narrow AI.  \nFirst and foremost, it is important to realize that while AI is used for \nforecasting and predictions and is generally future -looking, it uses histor-\nical data to try to find patterns and essentially \u2018fit\u2019 that data. Some of t he \nareas of application that have thrived due to this property of AI are facial \nrecognition, financial forecasting, medical image classification , and rec-\nommendation systems. The learning system by itself, while classifying \npreviously unseen examples, works  under the following assumptions:  \n- The input provided to train the AI model is all of the information \nneeded to predict the outcome  \n- The data itself (i.e. the \u2018ground truth \u2019) is correct and unbiased  \n- The future will not be too different from the past  \nThese as sumptions altogether have important implications on the \noutcomes. They can lead to potential risks, particularly where AI is de-\nployed for decision -making in the real world. In order to educate oneself \nabout AI, one should keep these assumptions in mind.  \nEducation systems can be \nadapted to prepare individuals \nfor an AI -powered world . \n- Himanshi Allahabadi  \nSome key considerations come to mind as a result of these assump-\ntions. For instance, it is important to think about the gap between the \ncontext of AI depl oyment and what AI can do, given the data at hand. We \nshould have clarity regarding  what the AI predicts, the key decision(s) be-\ning made based on the predictions, and the factors the system does not \naccount for.

Whether or not those factors have been \nappropriately considered for interpreting results and making decisions, \nspeaks to the goodness of the solution.   \nSecondly, it is important to consider what real -world policies and \npractices generate the data distrib ution. The AI system will more or less \ntry to emulate these policies and practices  implicitly, in the sense that its \npredictions will be consistent with what it learnt from the training data \nset unless explicitly trained to fulfi ll other objectives. For in stance, if a \nbank\u2019s policy for accepting loan applications is discriminatory, an AI sys-\ntem trained on their data will reflect and possibly amplify the same.  \nLastly, while AI can be a powerful tool to analyse and mine patterns \nfrom the data, it is important  to understand that sometimes future deci-\nsions cannot solely depend upon patterns learnt from historical data. To \nthat end, it is essential to recognize the need  for human expertise and \nknowledge.  \nEducation systems can be adapted to prepare individuals fo r an AI -\npowered world by teaching them how it fundamentally works, making \nthem aware of its potential, current limitations , and risks, and imparting \nthem with knowledge of different career paths that leverage or research \nAI and its impact. Ultimately, AI i s a problem -solving tool \u2013 albeit a rather \npowerful one. Education systems can encourage students to think about \nAI-based solutions for problems that they come across in their daily lives \nand empower them to use AI for environmental and societal good.  \nHimanshi Allahabadi  is a d ata scientist focusing on AI engineering and ethics.

Clearly, the danger with such biased \nsystems is that they contribute to social and political imbalances and re-\ninforce inequalities based on characteristics such as race, socioeco-\nnomic status, gender, sexual ident ity, and location.   \nResearchers3 describe five general harms that AI systems can create:  \n1. Allocation harm  occurs when systems extend or withhold opportuni-\nties, resources, or information. There is a risk of this type of harm \nwhen AI systems are used to make predictions and decisions about \nhow individuals qualify for things that can impact a person's liveli-\nhood  (e.g., an AI system used in hiring that withholds employment \nopportunities for women).  \n2. Quality of service harm  occurs when there is disproportionate prod-\nuct failure, and a system does not work as well for one person as an-\nother (e.g., a speech recognition system that does not work well for \nindividuals belonging to certain sociolects).  \n3. Stereotyping harm  occurs when systems reinforce existing societal \nstereotypes (e.g., a translator that associates \u2018she\u2019 to a nurse and \u2018he\u2019 \nto a doctor when translating from a gender -neutral language to Eng-\nlish).  \n4. Denigration harm  occurs when a system is derogatory or offensive \nto a subset of users or to all users (e.g., a face recognition system \nmisclassifying an African American as a primate).  \n5. Over /under  representation harm  occurs when systems either over -\nrepresent, underrepresent, or even completely exclude certain groups \nor subpopulations (e.g., a search algorithm that returns more images \nof men than women when a \u2018CEO \u2019 query is used).  \nTo address biases proactively, here are a few questions to think \nthrough:  \n- Who are the stakeholder populations that will be affected by the AI \nsystem, and how would the AI impact marginalized groups?  \n- How should the community of impacted stakeholders be involved to \ndefine fair outcomes?  \n- What is the composition of the training data? What is in it, what is \nmissing? For example, if an AI is only trained on certain facial charac-\nteristics (e.g., light -skinned faces) for facial recognition systems, then \nit may treat other individuals who do not share t hose same charac-\nteristics differently.  \n \n3 Fairness -related harms in AI systems - Microsoft Research", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2462, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ea55a59-5327-4bc2-9d61-eb13bf39d171": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ea55a59-5327-4bc2-9d61-eb13bf39d171", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "895cc3b7-7c64-429d-b768-a8ec02f0add6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "32c92b6a794ac0c241e905b92f4f04a868a7b5e4dd7307821ff802a482e8a514"}}, "hash": "71cb5418a77551b0d0b4d6231c043fe7ce25368e621ead2307f2eadd89fd1946", "text": "What are the ethical concerns associated with the \ngeneral adoption of A I?  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 145 - \n - Has the model been tested & benchmarked against affected sub-\ngroups?

Among the best -known examples are \nthose related to legal decisions: Based on AI, formerly imprisoned African \nAmerican candidates for probation were labelled higher -risk without  sub-\nsequently committing new offenses, whereas their white counterparts \nwere labelled lower -risk despite eventually re -offending9. This is an ex-\nample in which an AI -based legal deliberation has resulted in racism.  \nThere is also the case of automated recru iting processes.

Some even claim that straightfor-\nward measures such as the removal of classes would be a na\u00efve ap-\nproach to debiasing11 on the grounds that the accuracy of data would be \ncompromised by the absence of de tails of sex, race, etc.  \nYet, there are practices and methods that might contribute to coun-\ntering and reduc ing bias.

Mechanisms need to be developed to identify the processes most \nlikely to result in unfair discrimination and enable their monitoring.  \nHowever obvious the necessity of purely technical transformation is, \nwhat AI needs most in order to meet ethical expectations is an enhance-\nment of the human/technical balance in its processes.

Such a measure faces at least two con-\nsiderable barriers. First, there is the political/cultural factor, as some \ncountries do not perceive privacy as vital as some others do. There is \nalso a philosophical difficulty. Take the key concept of \u2018fairness \u2019 which \nturns out to be puzzling enough in itself. Contemporary professional phi-\nlosophy has provided el aborate and influential accounts of fairness12. \nYet, the mere fact that theoretical sophistication is still required in tack-\nling fairness, combined with the sheer absence of consensus on which \npractices count as universally fair, can be taken as evidence of the diffi-\nculties facing this potential measu re.  \nDespite the lack of a straightforward notion of fairness, however, \npromising ethical changes can be pursued on the basis of a distinction \nbetween discrimination in general and bias in particular, with some level \nof pragmatism: even admitting that algo rithms are essentially supposed \nto be discriminatory, we could filter out all those algorithms whose deci-\nsions are most likely to be interpreted as unfair by some stakeholders.  \nAny combination of the above debiasing measures, technical and hu-\nman, would hel p de -bias automated systems and increase the control \n \n10 Coeckelbergh, Mark: 2020: AI Ethics.

Many have the \nnotion that AI algorithms grounded in facts and  data must be the key to \nfighting against biased human judgement and decision -making. Unfortu-\nnately, the way systems are designed to create and record data points \nthat are used to train these algorithms are ultimately human constructs \nthat can be impacted by both  implicit and systemic biases.   \nFor example, medical algorithms that are trained on longitudinal elec-\ntronic health records are fully dependent on how individual healthcare \nprofessionals enter the records. Several studies show that there is evi-\ndence of implicit biases impacting healthcare professionals in medical \npractice22. If a doctor has implicit biases about taking a female patient\u2019s \npain less seriously than a male patient\u2019s pain, leading to fewer pain med-\nication prescriptions, then an algorithm a nalyzing pain medication treat-\nment patterns may pick up on these biases and further recommend lim-\niting treatments to female patients.  \nWithout intervention, AI algo-\nrithms can learn, codify and \nperpetuate biases long into the \nfuture.  \n- Veena Calambur  \nBeyond the biases perpetuated by individuals, one of the significant \ndrivers of AI bias comes from systemic biases that are embedded across \nseveral societal institutions. For instance, the history of the United States \nhousing industry is rife with racist p olicies such as redlining that barred \nAfrican Americans from homeownership in certain neighborhoods23. \nEven though these policies have been outlawed for over fifty years, we \ncan still observe their ramifications.

What i s the purpose and intended use of the AI system? Are there \nways that it can be misused or used unintentionally?  \n2. Who are the \u2018interactors\u2019 of the AI system? More, specifically, [a] Who \nare the primary intended end -user of the AI? Do they have adequate \nunde rstanding and autonomous controls over the system? And [b] \nWho may be influenced or impacted by the presence of the AI system \ndirectly or indirectly? Are they / their needs well represented in the \ndata and algorithm?  \n3. Are the AI \u2018creators\u2019 (i.e. data scien tists, machine learning engineers, \nsupporting operations, business sponsors) aware of ethical AI is-\nsues? And [a] Are they building in proper data and algorithm inspec-\ntions during the development and monitoring of AI systems?  [b] Are \nthe developer teams di verse and support a culture of responsible AI?  \nThere are a few steps to add to the AI algorithm development process \nto identify and mitigate bias. In the exploratory analysis, AI practitioners \nshould analyze how well represented the data population is whe n com-\npared to the target population of the AI solution. They should also ana-\nlyze the target outcome across key sub -populations based on de-\nmographics, protected characteristics, or customer segments. Upon \ntraining the AI model, it should be evaluated for bi as prior to deployment. \nBias evaluations should include model performance disparities checks , \nmodel explanation assessments , and model outcome or endpoints re-\nviews delineated by sub -populations.  If any bias is found, mitigation meth-\nods like matching algori thms, sampling techniques, or debiasing algo-\nrithms should be applied.  \nTo learn more about Ethical AI we should continue to review addi-\ntional materials, particularly from marginalized communities who have \nalready documented their experiences with AI and al gorithmic discrimi-\nnation. We should all develop a culture and governance to support re-\nsponsible AI development.  \nVeena Calambur  is a data scientist and AI ethicist.

While larger technology com-\npanies do have large amounts of private data that is no t shared, open \nsourcing of pre -trained models has had the effect of democratizing the \napplications of such models, with positive results for research and appli-\ncations.

As it grows more powerful \nand widespread, the ethical concerns around it become more important.  \nBias is a big issue in AI. As algorithms get smarter, they can learn our \nbiases. This means that the systems can end up perpetuating them.  \nThere are many ways that AI systems can become biased, but here \nis a list of main ones that we should be mindful of :  \n- The data used to train AI can be biased. If the data is not representa-\ntive of the whole population, the AI will be biased too. For example, if \na system is trained on a data set of men, it will be biased against \nwomen.  \n- People who design AI systems can als o be biased. They may inad-\nvertently include their own biases in the algorithms. For example, a \nprogrammer may design a system that gives a higher ranking to men \nthan women.  \n- People who use AI systems can also be biased. They may use the \nsystem in a way that  perpetuates their biases. For example, if a sys-\ntem is used to decide who to hire, the people who use it may be more \nlikely to choose men over women.  \n- AI can also get tainted once it's introduced into the world since, if the \nnew data being fed into the live  system is prejudiced, the algorithm \nmay learn from it and introduce bias. For example, a self -learning al-\ngorithm that is supposed to optimize a factory process could start \ndiscriminating against a particular ethnic group if it was fed discrim-\ninatory data.  \nThe i mplications of allowing b ias in AI systems can be significant, \nimpacting individuals and societies. Below are some real -life instances \nof bias that can have a significant impact if not addressed.  \n- Bias in Hiring . Many AI systems were used to help with  the hiring pro-\ncess. However,  in some cases,  these systems were biased against \nwomen  as they were more likely to recommend a man for a job than \na woman, even if the woman was more qualified26.  \n- Bias in Credit . AI systems are also often used to decide who t o give \ncredit  to. However, these systems are often biased27 against certain \ngroups of people, such as gender, minorities, or low -income people. \n \n26 Amazon's AI Was Biased Against Women (businessinsider.com)  \n27 Apple Card algorithm sparks gender bias inquiry - The Washington Post", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2540, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e80f111f-c82b-406b-b1fc-40bf608a3a79": {"__data__": {"id_": "e80f111f-c82b-406b-b1fc-40bf608a3a79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f54f9ab4-04db-495f-8f14-9831098aaab7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "7858f9d0dcdb10c7681111b361111d46e84867a9874d322cda30dedfa963870d"}}, "hash": "90948aac42bb272326382414ce8e82e11ce4cf98d72e5fb242ddaaebd8cc6927", "text": "What are the ethical concerns associated with the \ngeneral adoption of A I?  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 158 - \n This can lead to people not getting the loans they deserve or getting \nloans at a higher interest rate than they should.  \n- Bias in Policing . AI is also being used to help with policing. However, \nthese systems can also be biased28. For example, a recent study29 \nfound that a system designed to predict criminality was biased \nagainst black people. The algorithm was more likely to incorrectly \nflag a black person as being a criminal than a white person.  \n- Bias in Healthcare . AI is also being used to help with healthca re. How-\never, these systems can also be biased30. A study  found that a system \ndesigned to diagnose skin cancer was more likely to misdiagnose a \nblack person than a white person31.  \n \nWe also need to be mindful of other risks that come with the massive \npower and general adoption of AI. For example, AI could be used to ma-\nnipulate people : consider a scenario where a government use s AI to con-\ntrol the thoughts of its citizens or, a company that uses AI to get people \nto buy more products.  AI could also be used to d estroy people or things. \nFor example, a terrorist group could use AI to create a bomb that is very \ndifficult to detect. Also, AI could be used to steal people's personal infor-\nmation. For example, a hacker could use AI to steal your credit card de-\ntails.  \nThis raises the next question - how can we remove bias from AI sys-\ntems? There are several ways to consider, for example:  \n- We can make sure that the data used to train AI is representative of \nthe whole population.  \n- We can make sure that the people who design and use the AI systems \nare aware of their own biases and try to avoid them.  \n- We can have a diverse group of people worki ng on and using AI sys-\ntems. This will help to expose any biases that may be present in the \nsystem.  \n- We can test AI systems for bias before releas ing them  into the world.  \n- We can use Machine Learning to identify and correct bias in AI sys-\ntems.  \n- We can create a \u2018watchdog \u2019 group to monitor AI systems for bias.  \n \n28 What Happens When Po lice Use AI to Predict and Prevent Crime? - JSTOR Daily  \n29 Discriminating algorithms: 5 times AI showed prejudice | New Scientist  \n30 Millions of black people affected by racial bias in health -care algorithms (nature.com)  \n31 Characteristics of publicly available skin cancer image datasets - The Lancet Digital Health", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2514, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afe52d15-55f5-4f13-bce5-9e9f822eaa39": {"__data__": {"id_": "afe52d15-55f5-4f13-bce5-9e9f822eaa39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11b778fd-24e0-4bd5-abf9-a1a597ef2039", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "156e2c3d4fd804de3fd72a4aedffc51254c99c1937b5d50995e46dc45a98d190"}}, "hash": "0aae41615951290f5f3313f3d5289d347df9a4af788ef07fc13067f742e6ddae", "text": "What are the ethical concerns associated with the \ngeneral adoption of A I?  \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 159 - \n - we can create  a Code of Ethics for AI.

In my view , the true risk of AI originate s from \nthe fact that  when it is being used in uninformed or careless ways  it can \nlead to unfair or even inaccurate results.  \nWhen it comes to AI singularity, we are still too far from achieving \ngeneral AI to let this concern keep the masses up at night.

Most research and new technologies could be used in ways they \nwere initially not intended to and finally harm our societies.  With that said, \nthere is certainly the need for regulation and worldwide agreement to pre-\nvent the use of AI in unethical and unwanted ways.

Bias is omnipresent. It may be ma-\nchine learning bias (Selection, Exclusion, Observer, etc.), psychology , or \ncognitive (Dunning -Kruger Effect, Gambler\u2019s Fallacy, Ben Franklin Effect, \netc.). We also have new ones like the Google Effect36 and the IKEA  Ef-\nfect37.

Will AI be a threat to humanity? Un-\nlikely in the next 30 -40 years at least. We are still far away from Artificial \nGeneral Intelligence. So, is AI a threat to our jobs? Very much so. Approx. \n45% of low education workers will be at risk of technological unemploy-\nment by 2030. And can we trust the judgment of AI systems? Not yet is \nthe best answer for now. And for several reasons \u2013 bias being one of \nthem.  \nA classic example of bias in the Computational Linguistics world is \nthe we ll-known king \u2013 man + woman = queen  equation38. In this, if we \nsubstitute the word \u2018doctor \u2019 for the word \u2018king\u2019 we get \u2018nurse \u2019 as the fe-\nmale equivalent of the \u2018doctor \u2019. This undesired result reflects existing \ngender biases in our society and history. If do ctors are generally male \nand nurses are usually female in most available texts, that\u2019s what our \nmodel will understand.  \nAnother well -known example of an image classification mistake is \nwhen Google Photos misclassified black people as gorillas39.

AI Developers need large, carefully labelled, \nunbiased datasets to train Deep Neural Networks. The m ore dive rse the \ntraining data, the more accurate the AI models. The problem is that  gath-\nering and labelling sufficiently large and rich datasets , that may contain \na few thousand to tens of millions of elements , is a time -consuming and \nvery expensive  process . \nThe u se of synthetic data could be a possible answer. For example, a  \nsingle image costs about $6 from a labelling service. However, we can \ngenerate the same labelled image for as low as six cents in the lab. But, \ncost savings are just one aspect of the issue. Synthetic data is also key \nin dealing with privacy issues and reducing bias by ensuring you have the \ndata diversity to represent the real world. Furthermore, synthetic data is \nsometimes better than real -world data because they are automatically \nlabelled an d can deliberately include unusual but critical data properties.  \nThough the synthetic data sector is only a few years old, more than \n50 companies already provide synthetic data. Each has its unique quality, \noften focusing on a particular vertical market o r technique. For example, \na handful of these companies specialise in health care uses. A half dozen \noffer open -source tools or datasets, including the Synthetic Data Vault, a \nset of libraries, projects, and tutorials developed at MIT.  \nThe above is an excellent start to creating a more level playing field \nfor \u2018fair\u2019 AI Systems.  \nSamiran Ghosh  is a recognized thought leader in the AI/Blockchain space.

In a \nsimile to how those agreements formed the foundation for managing the \npolis, AI Ethics is now generating organizational, institutional, and social \ndebate.   \nAs organizations serve society, they must enrich their strategic lead-\nership agenda with ways to manage or mitigate the risks associated with \nAI applications.

Even Steve Wozniak shared that he had been given ten times the \ncredit limit offered to his wife. This controversy on AI bias went far from \njust an academic debate: Th e CEO of Goldman Sachs, the firm issuing \nand operating the card, had to publicly clarify the reasons behind such \nunfair outcomes and make the process more explainable.  \nAnother example of gender bias is Amazon\u2019s recruiting tool42, which \nalready in 2015 was identified not to be gender -neutral when rating can-\ndidates for various technical positions. The reason?

Politicians embark on this oppor-\ntunity to invent new regulation s, without having a deep understanding of \nthe technology. In fact, AI software is just like any other  software: It has \nsource  code that can be inspected, it has inputs and outputs that can be \nscrutinized, and computing theory clarifies that such software can be ex-\necuted on a primitive Turing Machine - just like any other software that \npeople use for many decades. The difference to \u2018classical \u2019 software is \nthat the ratio between data -driven vs. rule -driven (algorithmic) behaviour \nshifts. AI simply uses much more data and much fewer explicit encoded \nrules, which makes the behaviour less transparent, although not less de-\nterministic.  \nAI does not need more or dif-\nferent regulation s than classical \nsoftware.  \n- Jaroslav Bl\u00e1ha  \nIt is an engineering prerequisite for any kind of software product to \nbe designed and eventually tested and verified against its allocated re-\nquirements. For safety -critical or sensitive software, there exist plenty of \nstandards that mandate the necessary processes and level of scrutiny. \nExamples are DO -178C for aircraft systems, ISO -13485 for medical sys-\ntems, or EN -50128 for railway software.  \nEvery piece of (non -quantum) software and data is deterministic and \ncan be inspected down to its bits, e.g. of every neuron in an Artificial Neu-\nral Network.

The question of whether or not \nto regulate AI is a complex one, and there is no easy answer. It will de-\npend on the specific circumstances in each count ry and on the nature of \nthe technology itself. However, it  is clear that regulation is needed to en-\nsure that AI benefits society as a whole, rather than being used for harm. \nGovernments must act now to develop a framework for AI before it is too \nlate.  But h ow can we regulate AI?  There are several  ways to approach \nthis. One option is to develop a set of principles that AI technologies \nshould adhere to. These could include things such as a requirement to \nbe transparent and accountable, to avoid bias and d iscrimination, and to \nbe secure and reliable. We need to ensure that the AI models are trans-\nparent and explainable , and this can be achieved by:  \n- Providing a clear rationale for all actions  \n- Allowing for re -evaluation of decisions  \n- Being able to audit the decision -making process  \n- Allowing for human inspection and intervention  \nAnother option is to create a regulatory body specifically for AI which \nwould be responsible for licensing and monitoring AI technologies. This \ncould have a range of powers, such as the  ability to licence AI technolo-\ngies, to ensure that AI is being used safely and responsibly, to investigate \ncomplaints , and to impose sanctions on those who break the rules. A \nthird option is to develop a code of conduct for businesses using AI ; this \ncould cover areas such as data handling, privacy , and accountability. We \ncan also use existing laws and regulations to control AI. For example, \ndata protection laws could be used to ensure that personal data is pro-\ntected, or antitrust laws could be used to  prevent businesses from abus-\ning their monopoly power. All of these options have their advantages and \ndisadvantages, and no single solution is likely to be perfect. Which of \nthese options is best will depend on the specific circumstances in each \ncountry.  \nTo conclude, the AI revolution is a complex and fast -moving phenom-\nenon, and governments need to act now to develop a framework for reg-\nulating it. While it should be up to individual governments to decide how \nto regulate AI, it is important that they also take a holistic approach, look-\ning at all the different ways in which AI can be regulated.

Consequently, it \nquestions our societies and sometimes upsets the  organization of soci-\neties. Generally, it is the biases of certain AI systems  that worry people  \nand authorities  and raise the need for  an ethical approach to AI.  \nAn ethical approach to AI is fundamental , but it constitutes a colossal \nchallenge in legal thought. Indeed, the pace of development of AI is much \nfaster than the pace of development of legal texts. In general, the con-\nventional approach to regulating AI prompts the legal reflection that \nstarts from a \u2018principle \u2019. For example,  when authorities  want to legislate \non the use of data by AIs, they establish the principle of \u2018invasion of pri-\nvacy \u2019 and apply this to all AIs that use data , without nuance. This method, \nwhile commendable, has absolutely no effect on healthy AI control. In-\ndeed, the principle is vague  by definition and also,  AI has drifts that some-\ntimes escape these basic principles.  \nWith a consequentialist ap-\nproach , we can reduce  the logi-\ncal distance between ethics  and \nthe real excesses of AI . \n- Badr B oussabat  \nTherefore, it is necessary to leave the conventional approach in prin-\nciple and move more towards a more pragmatic approach. In other \nwords, a consequentialist approach. This method, which I consider to be \nmore effective, represents legal work typi cally the opposite of what we \nknow in general. The consequentialist approach would list all the con-\ncrete excesses of AI and group them by the \u2018degree of danger \u2019 for society.  \nThe legislator would review all AI applications on the market to create a \nsecond g roup.

Finally, the legislator will be able to distinguish the algorithmic bi-\nases according to the potential dangers and further extend the legislative \nlogic. This logic would therefore not be exclusively based on a starti ng \nprinciple but, instead, on a societal and technical understanding of AI. \nA major challenge is how to assess the level of risk at the start of \nlegal work  - due to algorithmic drift .

With such a broad range of AI use \ncases, regulation to determine acceptable uses must address the key \nrisks: what is the likelihood and quantum of harm AI could cause to indi-\nviduals, companies, and society? Does AI pose a safety risk? Does it in-\nfringe upon  our privacy and other human rights? Is there a risk that it \ncould be unfair to certain genders, ethnicities, or age groups? Could AI \nexclude certain societal groups? Could AI pose a result in financial insta-\nbility in markets? Could it be used for nefariou s activities?  \nHigh -risk AI use cases should \nnot stop technology from being \ndeployed.  \n- Simon Greenman  \nThese questions are embodied in the European Union\u2019s proposed \n2021 Artificial Intelligence  Act. This Act uses a risk -based approach to \nbucket AI use cases  into unacceptable, high, medium, and low risk. An \nexample of a high -risk, or even unacceptable use case, is facial recogni-\ntion technology. It is a commodity technology that can be deployed within \nhours. The potential for its misuse and infringement on civ il liberties is \nsignificant. The risk is so significant that companies such as IBM and \nMicrosoft demand regulation in this area. Some locations (such as San \nFrancisco) have instituted a moratorium on its use while others (such as \nthe EU) propos e its use be  limited to national security organizations. \nHigh -risk use cases should not stop technology from being deployed. Ra-\nther, there need s to be assurances that it is being deployed safely, ro-\nbustly , and fairly. This includes the assurance that the AI has been d e-\nsigned and is used so that it guards against issues of bias. We would \nalso need assurances that the technology is safe and robust in the real \nworld. Such  assurances must be required by government regulation.  \nEnsuring that AI technologies are fair, safe, a nd robust . Regulation \nshould ensure that companies embody legal and ethical AI principles in \nthe design, deployment , and maintenance of AI -driven systems.

Regulations \ncan help build trust. For example, airline passengers don\u2019t need to know \nexactly how an airplane reliably stays in the air. But they do trust that \ngovernments have robust safety regulations for airlines.  Similarly, regu-\nlation can build trust if it requires organizations that use AI to give visibil-\nity into how the AI technologies work. Regulation should require compa-\nnies to provide consumers with transparency and explainability of AI -\ndriven systems through mandatory Explaina bility Statements. The UK\u2019s \nInformation Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), is at the forefront of defining \nand enforcing the explainability of fully automated AI algorithms with le-\ngal effect.

Government regulation plays a key role \nto ensure that the AI playing field encompasses companies of all sizes \nfrom around the globe. There is a race among AI companies to supply \nthe chips, the computational power in the cloud,  and the AI algorithms to \npower the tens of millions of applications that will use AI. AI favours size, \nwith competition between Microsoft, Google, Amazon , and Apple to be \nthe AI supplier of choice. Similarly, in China, the competition is between  \nAlibaba,  Baidu , and Tencent. This is no coincidence. These companies all \nhave treasure troves of data from supporting billions of mont hly users, \nprocessing billions of transactions,  and searches ; they also have access \nto huge amounts of computer power to power their algorithmics. The \nmore data they process, the better their AI algorithms become, and the \nbetter the service they offer. And so the big get bigger.  \nWith so much technological and economic concentration in so few \ncompanies, regulators rightly hav e to address the questions of how to \nensure that these new monopolies are not causing harm to consumers, \nand customers, and ultimately reducing innovation.  \nSimon Greenman  is a technolog y innovator.

In principle, governments should not react  but antici-\npate . According to Luciano Floridi5, \"the best way to catch the technology \ntrain is not to chase it, but to be at the next station. In other words we need \nto anticipate and steer the ethical development of technological innova-\ntion\".  To do so, we need to understand the role of ethics in this proc ess. \nFirst of all, not all ethics are equal. Not that some are more worthy than \nothers, but fundamentally they have different purposes. For example, no \none would think of using ecology  ethics  to solve a bioethical  dilemma. \nSimilarly, some classical ethics are inefficient when the objects of study \nare not intentional agents .  \nSo the ethics I consider most suitable for this century is the ethics of \ninformation,  which stems from a brand new philosophy of information  de-\nveloped by Luciano Floridi. Choosing the right lens to look at the world \naround us is fundamental for any critical thinking that is not only \u2018critical \u2019 \nbut also proactive. I graduated in philosophy in the late 1990s, but worked \nfor years in the IT secto r.  \nThe philosophy of information approach is the only one I have ever \nbeen able to apply operationally. So if I have to philosophize, I can ramble \non Plato's Republic or Aristotle's Metaphysics, but when I have to choose \nand assess the impact of my ethica l choice, I use information ethics. So \nmy first answer is clear, before you start you have to understand what is \nhappening around you: because if you take the wrong glasses you see \nthe world blurred. And the Floridian glasses make it clear that the prob-\nlem is not technological, but informational.  \nA technological problem was Guttenberg's revolution: there is a sys-\ntem that changes society because it publishes and distributes infor-\nmation faster. But information and communication technologies do \nmore. They have separated the data from the information, and the infor-\nmation is created \u2018on -the-fly\u2019 for a specific purpose. This cut and paste is \none of the most important revolutions since the birth of agriculture and \nthe invention of the alphabet.

They \nwere  introduced in his 1942 short story \u2018Runaround \u2019, and are as follows:  \n1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a \nhuman being to come to harm . \n2. A robot must obey the orders giv en to it by human beings except \nwhere such orders would conflict with the First Law . \n3. A robot must protect its existence as long as such protection does \nnot conflict with the First or Second Laws . \nBut there have been significant technological advancements i n the \n75 years since the publication of the first story to feature his ethical \nguidelines. We now have a very different notion of what robots are capa-\nble of and how we will interact with them. Artificial Intelligence ha s given \nrise to three major areas of ethical concern for the human race: privacy \nand surveillance, bias and discrimination, apart from the larger question \nof the role of human judgment. These concerns have led experts to \nevolve some generic principles for AI  that can help to develop safe, eth i-\ncal, responsible, trusted, and sound AI systems . These principles are  cen-\ntred around these key areas:  \n1. Fairness . AI systems should treat all people fairly . \n2. Reliability & Safety . AI systems should perform reliably and safely . \n3.

People should be accountable for AI systems . \nEthics in AI is an evolving field. We have moved past debating what \nethics is, to the world of Responsible AI. Experts are developing guide-\nlines that will act as benchmarks for creating AI Systems as well as audit \npractices that will keep the systems in ch eck. These are all designed to \nensure that enterprises and governments have a framework to operate.  \nThe other way of approaching this problem is to provide tools in the \nhands of the end consumer to equip them with adequate protection \nagainst the inappropri ate use of algorithms. We need to look at this from \nthe lens of digital identity secured by advanced cryptography in the hands \nof the end consumer. It allows the citizen to hold the enterprise and the \ngovernment of the day accountable to the principles of AI. It also allows \nthe individual the discretion to turn on/off the use of their personal data.  \nPlatforms derive their power from the data they possess about indi-\nviduals. A majority of the unethical use of information stems from having \nunfettered access to data. Therefore, controlling the flow of this data is \nthe way to manage and regulate the imbala nce in this power equation. A \npossible solution would  provide capabilities to store, share and manage \nall digital identities through smart contracts - Self Sovereign Identity \n(SSI), which is truly decentralised.  \nSSI will allow users to self -manage their d igital identities without de-\npending on third -party providers to store and centrally manage data. Fur-\nthermore, it would let people have the option to decide if they want to \nshare their data or not, depending on the defined purpose. The next ver-\nsion of this solution would be the ability for everyone to control what they \nshare with whosoever asks for that data. Owning your identity would be \ngenuinely a decentralised Web 3.0, and systematised trust could be the \nnew oil of the digital economy.   \nAnd this is the a rea of study I would like to see develop ed further \u2013 \nUse of Self -Sovereign Digital Identities by Citizens to Drive adoption of \nResponsible AI.

The barriers to entry are seem-\ningly low.  For example, anyone with an idea and a credit card can start a \ncompany and challenge the incumbents. But there is also a centralizing \ntendency and a winner -take -most dynamic at play.  \nThis has given rise to BigTech, which arguably has more power than \nmany nations today. Naturally, there are calls for regulating BigTech. Sim-\nilarly, in AI the odds favour the dee p-pocketed companies because AI \nbreakthroughs require massive amounts of data, huge computing power, \nand highly skilled talent. But the whys, and hows of BigTech regulation \nare different from those of AI regulation.

But protect them from what? From \nthe harmful effects of AI and products that use AI. But  why does AI cause \nharm? Such questions lead us to the topic of AI Ethics and the careful \nconsideration of algorithmic bias. Contrary to popular perception, AI per-\nformance can vary significantly based on factors such as the training \ndata and the types of m odels used. Outside of the data on which it\u2019s \ntrained, an AI model can result in high error rates.

Deep learning AI systems are not intuitive and there is a  \n\u201cbecause AI said so\u201d angle to the ir automated decisions. Even if AI is per-\nforming better than the current baseline, a few highly -publicised errors \ncan undermine confidence in their reliability. Furthermore, if the deci-\nsions are challenged, there needs to be an easily understood rationale.   \nTo increase the transparency and explainability of Deep Learning sys-\ntems, technical and non -technical solutions are emerging. Documenta-\ntion of datasets, specifying the boundary conditions for AI usage, relying \non AI techniques that are more explainable, and deconstructing how AI \nmodels arrived at the decision (aka explainability) are some example ap-\nproaches to increase the transparency and trust. Trust in AI systems is a \nnecessary condition for their adoption.  \nAs to the how of AI regulation, a wide range  of regulatory tools and \napproaches are available. There is self -regulation where industry partici-\npants voluntarily establish standards and best practices and agree to \nabide by them. Organizations declaring their support for Responsible AI \nprinciples and s tandards is an example. Independent audits and third -\nparty certifications of compliance to standards define the next level.  \nWe already have product safety, consumer protection, and anti -dis-\ncrimination laws, which also apply to products and services that u se AI. \nWhen AI makes mistakes, the consequences depend on the context and \nuse case. For example, autocorrect not working properly carries low \nstakes, while getting charged for a crime because of an AI error, has a \nmassive impact and must be avoided. The ba r for AI should be set higher \nwhen the cost of errors and consequences of mistakes is high. That\u2019s \nexactly the level -of-risk approach to regulation currently being consid-\nered in the EU. Additionally, sector -specific regulation can bring contex-\ntual granular ity to regulation.  \nAI is not only a horizontal technology with broad applications but also \na dual -use technology, meaning that it can be put to both good and bad \nuses. AI requires updates to our regulatory approach and upgrades to our \nrisk architectures. As a final note on regulation, AI easily crosses borders \nand we also need global treaties and conventions, particularly for AI used \nin warfare and military applications.  \nKashyap Kompe lla is an award -winning industry analyst, best -selling author, educator, \nand AI advisor to leading companies and start -ups in US, Europe , and Asia -Pac.

If you look at the Latin etymology, complex means made \nup of several parts (cum+plexus). In a computational sense, when some-\nthing is complex we just need more resources to solve it. So AI uses a \nsum of specific skil ls to solve easy problems, but cannot solve difficult \nthings. AI plays chess very well, but we don't use it to tie our shoes.  Play-\ning chess is complex.

And since AI couldn't re-\nduce the difficulty of tying shoes to a complex task,  it can't do it.  \nThe reality of a democracy is so \ndifficult that it cannot be re-\nduced to a sum of elements.  \n- Enrico Panai  \nNow a question arises; is democracy difficult (which again comes \nfrom the Latin dis+facile and means not -easy) or is it the sum of a  num-\nber of small, simple problems? Here a worldview comes into play. The \nengineering tendency (in the history of mankind) has been to try to reduce \ndifficulty into many small problems in order to solve them. Rene Des-\ncartes, the father of modern critical th inking advised to divide every diffi-\nculty into as many parts as possible and necessary to solve each prob-\nlem separately (Discourse on Method, 1637).

But we can make the \nmost of AI in all those syntactical processes that it is so good at.  We can \nentrust it with the complex tasks.

The Intergov-\nernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports are based on \nmany climate models to show a range of predictions, which are then \naveraged out. AI is helping to determine which models are more reli-\nable and t hereby improving the accuracy of climate change projec-\ntions.  \n- Circular Economy . Circular economy principles are meant to design \nout waste and pollution, keep products and materials in perpetual \nuse, and regenerate natural systems. The advantages are substa ntial, \nfor example, in Europe alone we could create a net benefit of Euro 1.8 \ntrillion by 20301. AI can play an important role in accelerating circular \neconomy development by a) reducing time required to prototype b) \nsupporting product as a service, at the operational stage, with better \nasset utilization, demand prediction, preventive maintenance , and \nsmart inventory management , and c) optimiz ing circular infrastruc-\nture in clo sing the loop by improving the processes to sort and disas-\nsemble products, remanufacture components and recycle materials, \ncomponents, and materials.  A report by the Ellen MacArthur Founda-\ntion highlights that the potential value unlocked by applying AI in \nsome or all the principles (Design, Operation , and Infrastructure) in \nthe food industry is up to USD 127 billion a year in 2030. Equivalent \nAI opportunity in the consumer electronics is up to USD 90 billion a \nyear in 2030  \n- AI for Energy . The electric grid i s one of the most complex machines \non Earth. However, it is evolving rapidly with the addition of variable \nrenewable energy sources. Due to the inherent variability of wind and \nsolar, the current grid faces many challenges in accommodating the \ndiversity of  renewable energy. The utility industry needs smart sys-\ntems that can help improve the integration of renewables into the ex-\nisting grid and make renewable energy an equal player in the energy \nsupply. AI and I oT technologies can fill this gap by improv ing the reli-\nability of renewable energy and moderniz ing the overall grid.  Firstly, \nwhen coupled with AI , smart & centralized control centers offer flexi-\nbility to energy suppliers to cleverly adjust the supply with demand. \nSecondly, AI enables improved integr ation of microgrids. Thirdly, it \nimproves safety and reliability with AI to manage intermittency. \nFourthly, the integration of AI can help renewable energy suppliers \nexpand the marketplace by introducing new service models and en-\ncouraging higher participat ion. A couple of big players like Xcel En-\nergy and General Electric in the energy field are already harnessing \nthe power of AI in the renewable energy space.  \n \n1 Artificial intelligence and the circular economy (ellenmacarthurfoundation.org)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2934, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5bedb958-17e5-42bf-8699-e1f241daba5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5bedb958-17e5-42bf-8699-e1f241daba5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7cae21eb-48da-40f7-ac1a-35d7d7fa91fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "6e63a155e9d4752fbd41aa2132cd9fdc265b733979b286416143d7aa210dc6c1"}}, "hash": "0e787572ab0606e3c4e962d093f375eab2bb71bbb5578357d650d134351b78b4", "text": "Can AI help us solve humanity\u2019s burning problems \nlike climate change ? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 210 - \n Artificial Intelligence  has a huge potential for sustainability and cli-\nmate change that is yet unta pped.

Grid integ ration with AI is required to deliver a reliable \nelectricity system and assist to get to Net Zero Carbon.  \nThere are ongoing development s in the area of Machine Learning that \nattempt to tackle climate change from within the energy sector. For ex-\nample , from the Demand Side Management (DSM)7, by processing his-\ntorical energy consumption and weather datasets , AI algorithms can de-\nrive forecas ts of electricity production from alternative sources  and use \nthem  to optimise  the demand. As a result , the power generation can be \nmaximised leading to a better -managed electricity grid. The latter can be \nquite diverse given the different sources of energy generation (solar, \nwind, geothermal, remnant fossil fuels, stored hydro). In terms of De-\nmand Response (DR) , the consumers are empowered with their own IoT -\nbased management tools and they can shift their electricity providers \nand/or usage based on the energy market prices (on the basis of re-\nsponse times, services offered , and different business models).  \nIn the  supply chain sector , based on metrics from the International \nEnergy Agency (IEA), transport emissions must be decrease d by 43% be-\nfore 2030. Freight logistics operations in Europe are struggling with ways \nto reduce their carbon footprints to adhere to regu lations on governing \nlogistics while satisfying the increasing demand for sustainable products \nfrom the customers. AI can empower efficient, optimised logistics \nthrough the continuous processing of streams of data captured  from IoT \ndevices  in real -time . Physical Internet8 algorithm s have proved to per-\nform better in terms of reducing emissions and improving the logistics\u2019 \nefficiency, especially when the sample sizes are large . But this would re-\nquire a shift to an open global supply web , through digital twin s, with real -\ntime data utilised in simulation  and machine learning  models,  and intelli-\ngent decision -making  algorithms .  \nHowever, technology on its own is not the solution . This vision can \nbecome a reality only if we take into account the h urdles of Machine \nLearning , as it is not a panacea for climate change. AI is a tool to help us \nfight climate change and we need to follow a cost -benefit approach , \ngiven that AI has its own growing carbon footprint. Current research es-\ntimates indicate the I CT sector to be responsible for between 1.4% to \n23% of the global emissions by 2030  (depending on the energy sources) .  \nWhile Machine Learning algorithms can identify faults and predict \nweather and levels of energy production and consumption, the global so-\nciety needs to be aware that certain actions are needed as well.  AI can \nstrengthen the applications towards smart decision -making for d ecar-\nbonising buildings and transport , and allocate renewable energy, but \nthese toolkits will be effective only when human beings are aware of the \n \n7 Energy demand management - Wikipedia  \n8 Physical Internet - Wikipedia", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3209, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf6b14bd-39bb-47a9-9401-3d896c2e2a43": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf6b14bd-39bb-47a9-9401-3d896c2e2a43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83e32898-0119-4886-a041-71d8e68f86a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "212", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "e11c9d00b1e038d806895745757b9dbd95f226a8efc621fce329d5f09943493e"}}, "hash": "1010b2398a4cc5ecb186481bdfbcf48d96569b18f193a02516c2bbfaa5af9ce5", "text": "Can AI help us solve humanity\u2019s burning problems \nlike climate change ? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 212 - \n long -term benefit  - and this might require a change of behaviour in terms \nof energy consumption.

Therefore, the \ngeopolitics of States may be influenced by the populations themselves. \nBy way of illustration, the most powerful states in the world today, like \n \n1 Global AI market predicted to reach nearly $1 trillion by 2028 (thenextweb.com)  \n2 Made in China 2025: Xi Jinping's plan to turn China into the AI world leader - ABC News", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2188, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ec8877d-1e30-4533-8e17-04a8f3824dcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ec8877d-1e30-4533-8e17-04a8f3824dcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a83b5d68-d25d-4418-8524-d0860ddedab9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "217", "file_name": "60-LEADERS-ON-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-2022.pdf"}, "hash": "cc589cb16079c99b72e74b99961d9bc68f8bbeb921ff1f52376ea566bebb40f2"}}, "hash": "28fb97e07b28b454ba7a211535129d3f639f85f3a2a9d525abbd38dd39add828", "text": "How is AI changing the global, geopolitical system ? \n60 LEADERS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  - 217 - \n the United States and China, fully capitalize on this strategy.

No wonder Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google \nand current chair of the US National Security Commission on AI, recently \nwarned5 that China risks pulling ahead of the US in AI. He actively encour-\nages the US government to increase their annual R&D investment in AI \nfrom $1.5 billion to $32 billion by 2026.   \nWith a history of architecting, engineering, and building at a massive \nscale, China is focused on how to use AI across its vast population of 1.4 \nbillion. Their government is addressing the question of how AI can be \nused to improve education, the legal sys tem, healthcare, transportation , \nand infrastructure, along with security.  \nThe value of AI really comes when it is applied. China is likely to be \nthe leader in applied AI given the country\u2019s scale. Those that are doing AI \nwill set the standards, become the makers of AI, and ultimately extract \nthe economic value both nationally and internationally.    \nThe geopolitical risks of AI are not just economic.
